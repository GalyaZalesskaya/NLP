Nicola Sturgeon has agreed to a wider inquiry into Scottish education after opposition MSPs united to demand one.

A study of the senior phase of schooling had already been ordered, but Holyrood voted to say this should be a "full review" of broader education.

SNP members opposed the move in the vote, but Ms Sturgeon said she would "abide by the decision of parliament".

The motion passed also said there were "key weaknesses in some key aspects of Scotland's school education" system.

Education Secretary John Swinney is to set out how the review will work in due course.

Mr Swinney had ordered a review into the senior phase of education in September 2019 after a critical report on narrowing subject choices from Holyrood's education committee.

This was to be carried out by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but now looks set to be expanded in light of the Holyrood vote.

MSPs voted by 63 to 60 - with the Conservatives, Labour, Greens and Lib Dems uniting to defeat the SNP - on Wednesday to call for "a full review of broad general education" and "an acceptance from the Scottish government that there are some key weaknesses in some key aspects of Scotland's school education and the qualifications structure".

Ms Sturgeon was challenged to accept this vote by interim Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw at her weekly question session.

The first minister noted that there has already been an OECD review of Scottish education in 2015, but said "we will abide by the decision parliament took yesterday, whether or not we consider that that is necessary".

Mr Carlaw said the inquiry must not be a "whitewash" and be a "proper investigation into the real problems that exist".

Ms Sturgeon replied that the review would be "independent and robust".

'Further improvement'

She added: "I have never stood here and said that there is not a need to look at where further improvement is required.

"Any fair-minded person would look at the reviews that this government has instructed so far and would not come to the conclusion that Jackson Carlaw has.

"There is progress in Scottish education. We want to see that progress continue and accelerate, and that is why we will continue to get on with that job."

The first minister also said she hoped the Conservatives would back all decisions of parliament, with MSPs set to vote on backing for a second independence referendum in the coming weeks.</text><tags>Scotland Education, Scottish Parliament, Scottish government, Nicola Sturgeon</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-51139619<category>uk</category><title>Labour leadership: Don't just blame 2019 campaign, Starmer warns</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sir Keir Starmer: We've lost four elections in a row

Sir Keir Starmer has warned against blaming Labour's historic election defeat on its 2019 campaign alone.

The leadership candidate said the party had been losing votes in its heartlands for a "long time" and had lost four general elections in a row.

People wanted "fundamental change" but did not trust Labour to deliver it, he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg.

He vowed to restore trust in Labour "as a force for good and a force for change" and end factional infighting.

But he refused to say whether his politics were closer to Tony Blair or Jeremy Corbyn, saying: "I want to lead a Labour Party that is trusted enough to bring about fundamental change.

"I don't need somebody else's name or badge to do that."

The BBC's political editor is aiming to interview all five Labour leadership hopefuls before the result is announced on 4 April.

'Overloaded manifesto'

Sir Keir, who has been endorsed by Britain's biggest union, Unison, said he could "unify the party" and "forge a path to victory at the next general election".

"We need to unify the party and I think I can do that," he said.

"We spent far too much time fighting ourselves and not fighting the Tories. Factions have been there in the Labour Party - they've got to go."

Some on the left have blamed the election defeat on Sir Keir and others at the top of the party promoting another Brexit referendum.

He said: "We were trying to bring together both sides whether they voted Leave, or they voted Remain.

"But I think the idea that Brexit was the only issue in this election is wrong, or even that in our heartlands it was the determining factor because actually if you look at what's happened in our heartlands we've been losing votes there for a long time."

Speaking at a pub in Somers Town, in his Holborn and St Pancras constituency, he said he believed Labour could win last year's election, even though the "odds were against us", but added: "In the end people didn't have trust in us.

"Partly that was to do with the leadership, rightly or wrongly, partly it was to do with Brexit, anti-Semitism came up, and the overload of the manifesto."

He said Labour needed to "restore that trust, but if we only look at the 2019 election we're missing the fact that we've lost four in a row".

He said his priority, as a "moral socialist", would be tackling the "gross inequality" in British society and ensuring "equal opportunity for everyone, wherever they come from and whatever their background".

"I don't need someone else's name or badge."

Sir Keir Starmer wouldn't today reveal whether he saw his ideas and his ambitions for the country as closer to Jeremy Corbyn or Tony Blair.

Instead, when we sat down in a north London pub in his constituency, he wanted to make the valid argument that different leaders work in different eras, confronting different problems.

Times change, essentially, and the next leader, he believes, needs to be looking to the next set of issues and try to take the party by the scruff of the neck and make it into an effective opposition straight away - but with an eye on where the political battles will be in 2024.

But his obvious reluctance to plant a flag somewhere on Labour's wide political spectrum is perhaps representative of the problem that he faces in this race.

Hustings planned

Sir Keir admitted he does have friends who are Tories, and that he received support from colleagues on the Conservative benches when his father died in 2018.

The shadow Brexit secretary said he judged people "by what they say and who they are, rather than which party they're in".

The five leadership contenders - Sir Keir, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Emily Thornberry, Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy - are set to take part in a series of hustings around the country, starting in Liverpool on Saturday.

They need the support of 5% of local parties or at least three affiliates - two must be unions - by 14 February to make it on to the final ballot of party members.

The new leader will be announced on 4 April.

It comes as the grassroots pressure group Momentum endorsed Mrs Long-Bailey.

The group, which grew out of Jeremy Corbyn's 2015 leadership campaign, said it would mobilise thousands of supporters to elect Mrs Long-Bailey as the next Labour leader.

Momentum polled members on whether it should officially back Mrs Long-Bailey, with 70% of those who took part endorsing the plan, and 52% backing Angela Rayner as her deputy.

Around 14,700 people applied to register as temporary supporters of Labour to vote in the leadership contest, the party has said.

The 48-hour window to apply to be a temporary supporter closed at 17:00 GMT on Thursday. Applicants who meet the eligibility requirements will be able to vote in the leader and deputy leader elections.</text><tags>Labour Party leadership election, Keir Starmer, Labour Party leadership election</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46944694<category>technology</category><title>Amazon, Apple and Google face data complaints</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images

Entertainment streaming giants including Amazon, Apple, Google, Netflix and Spotify have been accused of breaking the EU's data regulations.

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules say EU customers have the right to access a copy of the personal data companies hold about them.

However, privacy group noyb said it found that most of the big streaming companies did not fully comply.

It has filed formal complaints, which if upheld could result in large fines.

What's the problem?

GDPR took effect in May 2018 and gives EU customers the right to demand a copy of their personal data from companies. That data must be easy to understand and should also be presented in a machine-readable format, so that a customer could transfer all their data to a competitor, for example.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: What is GDPR?

When GDPR took effect, many of the biggest names in tech including Amazon, Apple, Google and Spotify made changes, to let customers download a copy of their data.

But the privacy campaign group noyb, whose slogan is "My Privacy is none of your Business", said it found many of the biggest services did not do enough to comply with the law.

What did they find?

Individuals working with noyb requested a copy of their data from several movie and music streaming services.

They found Amazon, Apple, Spotify and Google's YouTube all let people download a copy of their personal information quickly. But noyb said that only some of the data was "intelligible", with some parts supplied in a format that could not be understood by people.

The GDPR requires the data to be both machine-readable and easily understood by customers.

All four streaming giants also failed to supply additional information to which people are entitled, such as a list of other companies with whom their data was shared.

Netflix supplied the requested data in a format that was easy to understand, but did not supply all the additional information and took about 30 days to reply.

Soundcloud and UK-based streaming service Dazn did not reply to the information requests at all.

Privacy activist Max Schrems, diector of noyb, said: "In most cases, users only got the raw data, but, for example, no information about who this data was shared with.

"This leads to structural violations of users' rights, as these systems are built to withhold the relevant information."

Complaints filed

Noyb said it had filed 10 complaints with Austria's data protection regulator.

The maximum penalty for a breach of the GDPR is 20 million euros (&#163;17.7m) or 4% of a company's global turnover.

In theory, Apple could be fined &#163;7bn if the regulatory authority rules that it has broken the law.

The BBC has contacted the named companies for comment.

Spotify said in a statement: "Spotify takes data privacy and our obligations to users extremely seriously. We are committed to complying with all relevant national and international laws and regulations, including GDPR, with which we believe we are fully compliant."</text><tags>Netflix, Privacy, Data protection, Google, Spotify, Amazon, Apple, GDPR, Streaming</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51130260<category>uk</category><title>Crown Court filming ban to be lifted in England and Wales</title><text>Video

President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.

His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally.

He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (&#163;388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.

One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: "We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible".

Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.

Read more here.

But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office.

It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018.

Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.

The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump believes the US is being unfairly treated by other countries when it comes to trade

That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods.

So a success for President Trump? Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't.

Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example.

Global Trade

More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:

Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.

Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: "If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump's tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading

President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods.

There is an idea in economics known as the "twin deficits hypothesis", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services.

It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.

So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.

That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an "instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone". But it's not true she says.

Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers.</text><tags>Trump tariffs, China-US relations, Asia Pacific, US economy, Donald Trump, Global trade, Economics</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-51070480<category>uk</category><title>Lyme disease like 'waking with a hangover' every day</title><text>A man forced to quit work because of Lyme disease hopes pop star Justin Bieber's admission he has it will raise awareness of the condition.

Mark Morgan, from Cardiff, said the illness is so debilitating he can no longer work because of the "constant symptoms of anxiety and fatigue".

There are about 3,000 cases of the disease - a bacterial infection spread by ticks - each year in the UK.

Ex-engineer Mr Morgan said people do not understand its long-lasting impact.

He has been experiencing symptoms that could be attributed to Lyme disease since puberty.

The 54-year-old said it became "increasingly difficult" to hold down a job as he got older because of the long term effects of the disease and in 2015 he had to stop working completely.

It got to the point Mr Morgan was sleeping in his car on his lunch break so he could finish his day at work.

He said people often do not understand that his symptoms of fatigue and anxiety are severe.

"People often remark that I look OK, but I don't feel OK," Mr Morgan said.

He said he was "quite pleased" to get the diagnosis after his illness was dismissed by doctors, but he did not realise how difficult the condition was to treat.

"People need to understand that it is a serious, potentially long-term condition. The symptoms are dreadful," he said.

"People need take precautions to avoid being bitten by ticks and, if bitten, seek immediate medical treatment."

Earlier this month, pop star Justin Bieber announced he had been living with Lyme Disease for what he described as a "rough couple of years".

The Canadian took to Instagram to share that he was suffering from the chronic infection after speculation he had a drug problem.

Bieber told his 124 million Instagram followers the disease had affected his "skin, brain function, energy, and overall health".

Singer Avril Lavigne and supermodel Bella Hadid have previously revealed that they also suffer from Lyme disease.

Bieber's supermodel wife, Hailey Bieber, defended her husband on Twitter against criticism from those "trying to downplay the severity of Lyme disease".

"Please do your research," she urged them.

A spokeswoman for charity Caudwell LymeCo said the news about Bieber shows the disease "really can affect anyone" and hoped his announcement would "reach a new audience who might be suffering similar symptoms without knowing the root cause".

What is Lyme disease?

A bacterial infection carried by some species of ticks and about 13% in the UK are believed to be infected

It cannot be passed on from person to person

Symptoms - including the bulls-eye rash, fatigue and fever - usually develop around three weeks after a bite

The majority of those who take the full three-week course of antibiotics make a full recovery

The US National Security Agency (NSA) has warned Microsoft Windows users to make sure they are using updated systems to guard against cyber-attacks.

US officials and Microsoft executives say older versions of the programs may be vulnerable to malware.

In the advisory, NSA officials said a flaw known as "BlueKeep" exists in past editions of Microsoft Windows.

Last week Microsoft warned that "some older versions of Windows" could be vulnerable to cyber-attacks.

"All customers on affected operating systems [Windows 7 and earlier] should update as soon as possible," said Microsoft.

US officials said the "BlueKeep" flaw could leave computers vulnerable to infection by viruses through automated attacks or by the downloading of malicious attachments.

They said ransomware can often be installed quickly, holding files hostage and demanding payment from individuals.

The vulnerability in the older versions of Microsoft Windows, wrote the International Computer Science Institute's Nicholas Weaver, means that bad actors could "gain complete control of the remote system".

Updating systems, as the Microsoft executives explained, helps to protect computer users from these kinds of cyber-attacks.

Recently a ransomware attack on the city of Baltimore disrupted municipal services, knocking city workers offline and making it harder for people to pay their traffic tickets and water bills.

The New York Times has reported that the NSA knew about the system flaw, EternalBlue, but kept it secret for years.

EternalBlue has been implicated in a range of cyber-attacks over the past three years, including the WannaCry assault that disrupted the UK's NHS.

A senior NSA adviser, Rob Joyce, tweeted on his own account that some computer users could face a "significant risk" because of the vulnerabilities in the older versions of Microsoft Windows, but that they would be protected by updates.

The NSA issues advisories to private companies and to computer administrators on a regular basis.

But their warning about BlueKeep, along with Mr Joyce's posting on social media and the attention the NSA advisory has received on social media, showed "the likely seriousness of the vulnerability", says the Atlantic Council's Christopher Porter.

Microsoft executives emphasised there has been no sign of danger from a new cyber-attack and that updating systems will protect the computer users from any threats.

The company executives also reminded customers that keeping "internal systems updated with the latest fixes" is crucial to keeping people and computers safe from malware.

Defending their reputation

By Tara McKelvey, BBC News

NSA analysts and directors have been in the spotlight lately because of the ransomware attack in Baltimore, and Rob Joyce's tweet was part of their effort to show they are working hard to protect the US from future cyber-attacks.

He and officials at the NSA are trying to be more aggressive in their effort to inform the public, and in this way they are working to tamp down criticism of their agency.

In a more general sense, NSA officials have been under fire for not sharing important information about their activities with the public, and Mr Joyce is trying to change that image by communicating directly with Microsoft users on social media - and explaining to them the dangers they face.</text><tags>Cyber-crime, Cyber-security, Cyber-attacks, Microsoft</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47494760<category>technology</category><title>Urgent warning over 'serious' Windows 7 bug</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Windows 7 was released in 2009 but is still widely used

Windows 7 users are at risk from a "serious" bug that could let malicious hackers take over their computer, Google has warned.

Cyber-thieves are "actively exploiting" the vulnerability by combining it with a separate flaw found in the Chrome browser.

Google has issued an update for its Chrome web browser to close the loophole.

Microsoft has said it is also working on a fix for the problem in Windows 7.

Squashing bugs

The Windows flaw exists in core elements of the operating system that are supposed to stop data in one program interacting with anything outside that application.

Google said it had seen evidence that criminal hackers had found a way to make attack code jump from Chrome into other applications to help them compromise a machine.

A patch has been produced for Chrome and users should ensure that they have updated their browser to close the loophole, said Google engineer Justin Schuh.

"Seriously, update your Chrome installs... like right this minute," he tweeted.

The serious nature of the flaw in Chrome meant the software had to be shut down and re-started for the patch to take effect, he added.

"To date, we have only observed active exploitation against Windows 7 32-bit systems," wrote Clement Lecigne from Google's threat analysis group in a blog exploring the flaw.

One way to avoid falling victim was to upgrade to Windows 10, said Mr Lecigne.

Microsoft has not given a date for when its patch for Windows 7 will be released, but said it would be "as soon as possible". Millions of machines still run Windows 7 despite it being almost 10 years old.

Writing on the Sophos security blog, Paul Ducklin said: "There doesn't seem to be a workaround, but if you make sure you're up-to-date, you don't need one because the bug will be squashed."</text><tags>Google, Cyber-security</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51100759<category>world</category><title>US officials ground drones over espionage fears</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many drones in the US are made by DJI, a company based in Shenzhen (shown here)

US officials may put an end to a civilian drone programme because of their concerns about the unmanned aerial vehicles that are made in China. The officials are apparently worried that the Chinese-made drones could be used to spy on people in the US.

After a volcano exploded in Hawaii in May 2018, US scientists used drones to save a man from the lava: "Follow the drone," they said. He made it through the jungle.

Drones save people. They also map terrain, survey land and inspect pipelines. The scientists use drones for these and other purposes on a daily basis, and they have bragged about their successes in the field.

Many of the aircraft are made by Chinese companies, though. They are now grounded because of concerns about espionage.

The drones had been deployed for years by the scientists and others at the US Department of the Interior, a federal agency that manages national parks and other duties. But the head of the federal agency, David Bernhardt, is apparently now worried that the drones could be used for espionage.

He is examining the agency's civilian drone programme in an effort to determine whether or not it should be continued. During this time, many of the drones are grounded, according to an agency spokeswoman, Melissa Brown. "Until this review is completed, the secretary has directed that drones manufactured in China or made from Chinese components be grounded," according to a statement she sent to the BBC.

Drones that are used to fight fires and help rescue people are still allowed to fly, she added. News of the fleet's grounding was first reported in the Financial Times.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Drones such as this one, an aircraft flown in Los Angeles, look for forest fires

Mr Bernhardt's review of the drone programme reflects a growing concern among US officials about Chinese technology and espionage.

President Donald Trump has spoken in dark terms about China, saying that its leaders have "cheated" the US and that its intelligence agents spy on people here. Chinese officials deny the accusations. Despite the rhetoric, US-China relations have improved.

On Wednesday, Trump is planning to sign an initial trade deal with Chinese leaders. Still, fundamental issues remain, such as the fight over technology. US officials have said in the past that Huawei, the telecommunications company, and other Chinese companies could pose a security threat.

Some Chinese analysts say the fight is not over national security but market share. The Chinese are better at making products, they say, and Americans are jealous. The Chinese analysts see the US policies as a form of protectionism.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chinese-made drones, an array that includes these models shown in Guangzhou, have sparked controversy in the US

The drones are now at the centre of the US-China dispute.

Many of the drones that are used by US scientists are made by a Shenzhen-based company called Da Jiang Innovations Science and Technology Company, or, DJI. The company dominates the drone market, according to a research company, Skylogic.

US officials have in the past expressed concerns about DJI. Agents at a US immigration office said in 2017 that the company's drones could collect information about US sites and transmit data back to Beijing.

Rules and norms are different for private companies in China than they are in the US. Business executives in China stay in close contact with government officials. US officials worry about the information that Chinese drones could collect and what might be done with the data.

The Chinese executives could pass the data on to Beijing officials, explains Sarah Cook, a senior analyst with Freedom House, a non-profit organisation.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Drones made by a Chinese company, DJI, are under suspicion in the US

Executives who work for DJI say their drones are trustworthy. Michael Oldenburg, a spokesman for DJI Technology Inc, tells the BBC there is no "credible evidence to support a broad country-of-origin restriction on drone technology".

Many US analysts agree with Oldenburg's assessment. "I doubt the Chinese government is using the drones to conduct massive surveillance," says David Fidler, an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Fidler and others admit it is impossible to know how much information the drones are gathering, however. Analysts emphasise that the Chinese officials pose a threat to the US and that Chinese companies should be banned from certain kinds of work.

"I wouldn't want a Chinese server operating our nuclear system," says Paul Rosenzweig, a senior fellow at the conservative R Street Institute who served as a US Department of Homeland Security official during the George W Bush White House years.

Yet Rosenzweig and others say that the drones seem benign. The aircraft fly over wildlife areas and parks and are unlikely to collect sensitive data. "It is an acceptable risk," Rosenzweig says, adding: "I don't think drones covering Yosemite National Park are a real threat."

The real assessment, the one from the secretary of the interior, is yet to be announced, however. In the meantime, scientists and others wait - and wonder - about the fate of the drones.</text><tags>Spying, China, United States, Drones</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51088260<category>world</category><title>The Indian small-town shop owner who became a TikTok star</title><text>Video

The majority of people who believe they have a chronic form of Lyme disease are more likely to have chronic fatigue syndrome, experts suggest.

There are around 3,000 cases of Lyme disease, caused by tick bites, in the UK each year.

Most of those who take antibiotics make a full recovery within months.

But infectious disease doctors are warning that long-term Lyme disease cases are often misdiagnosed through expensive and unvalidated tests abroad.

Dr Sarah Logan, from London's Hospital for Tropical Diseases, said: "Most people who now think they may have had Lyme disease, in fact have a syndrome that is more in keeping with chronic fatigue syndrome."

Speaking at a Science Media Centre briefing, she added: "And because there is increased awareness about it, they are testing for Lyme disease and then they are going on to various different Lyme disease forums on the internet and being told, 'Well actually the UK tests are rubbish, but you need to send it off to Germany.'

"Then they are coming back with a test that is positive and saying, 'You doctors are all wrong and I don't have chronic fatigue syndrome, I have chronic Lyme disease.'

"I think that most people who think they have got Lyme disease in the UK, probably don't."

'Alternative' diagnosis

She cited two cases she had seen where patients, believing they had chronic Lyme disease, had been taking intravenous antibiotics - one developed a Clostridium difficile infection as a result of being on the medication for more than six months. The second patient also developed a serious infection.

Dr Logan said it could be that chronic fatigue syndrome was a difficult diagnosis for doctors to give, because it could be hard for patients to get treatment and support, and because of persisting negative views of the condition.

"I think there is a bit about patients not wanting to hear it because of all those stigma reasons, and there is a little bit about GPs hoping - probably not unreasonably - and saying, 'Let's look for an alternative diagnosis because then that is something we can treat.'"

When a Lyme disease test comes back negative, patients may decide to seek testing elsewhere, she said, adding that some patients were paying up to &#163;600 for a consultation and test that has not been validated.

Dr Matthew Dryden, a consultant microbiologist at Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said he was also concerned about the issue of "chronic" Lyme disease.

"These are reported as true cases of Lyme when almost certainly they're not. The symptoms are very real but most medical tests tend to be normal which confuses both doctors and patients."

He said the focus should be improving the management and care offered to patients with chronic fatigue.

"It really needs improved research and improved management services for these patients."

What is Lyme disease?

Lyme disease is caused by bacteria carried by some species of ticks - around 13% in the UK are believed to be infected

It cannot be passed from person to person

Symptoms - including the bullseye rash, fatigue and fever - usually develop around three weeks after a bite

The majority of those who take the full three-week course of antibiotics make a full recovery

The New Forest and the Scottish Highlands are known Lyme disease hotspots - but people should take care wherever there is long grass

The NHS test, which is highly accurate, looks at antibodies the body produces, which can take some weeks to reach detectable levels

Drivers of high-polluting vehicles will have to pay to drive around parts of Birmingham after the government approved plans for a Clean Air Zone.

The city council was given a final warning by the European Commission in 2017 to clean up its air by 2020 and could be fined &#163;60m if it fails.

Motorists in petrol cars built before 2006 and diesels before 2015 will have to pay &#163;8 under the proposals.

The chargeable area is within the A4540 ring road, but not the road itself.

Analysis by the local authority found air pollution was responsible for shortening the lives of about 900 people a year.

The authority was granted &#163;38m from the Clean Air Fund towards mitigation costs, although it wanted &#163;50m, and &#163;14.2m despite wanting &#163;17.8m to go towards implementation costs, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.

Up to &#163;15m will go towards supporting Hackney Carriage and private hire drivers who argue the zone is a threat to their livelihood.

Councillor Waseem Zaffar said getting more than three-quarters of the money asked for was "substantial".

Mr Zaffar, the council's transport and environment lead, said the authority would also try to address the potential problem of people "dumping" their cars near the edge of the zone and walking into the city.

Vehicles entering inside the ring road will be picked up by automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras.

Lava has started to emerge from the Taal volcano in the Philippines, as the nation prepares for a "hazardous eruption".

Local authorities have also declared a "state of calamity".

Meanwhile, the volcano has cast a lightning storm into the air, and the surrounding area has been blanketed with ash.

But how dangerous is the ash, why is there lightning in the clouds thrown up by Taal, and could this have an impact on the bushfires in Australia?

Dave Rothery, professor of planetary geosciences at the Open University, answers readers' questions.

What causes the lightning in the ash cloud? - Tim Donaldson

Lightning is a common phenomenon in volcanic eruption clouds, but we have certainly become more familiar with it thanks to the number of cameras capturing eruption pictures these days.

In an explosive eruption, rock is fragmented into tiny pieces, referred to as "ash" - though not a product of combustion like the ash from a fire. Those particles can carry electrical charges, while frictional collisions between grains can also build up charge.

If the positively-charged ash particles become separated from the negatively-charged particles in sufficient quantity, and the two oppositely charged regions become temporarily linked, this is a lightning bolt. A similar process occurs in thunderclouds.

It is thought in volcanic lightning the charges could be carried by ions - charged individual atoms - rather than specks of ash.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Ash has started falling on areas around the volcano

Is the ash a hazard to one's health? - Robert Aguiniga

Volcanic ash poses a number of health hazards.

It is a nasal and respiratory irritant, and so people need to avoid inhaling it - which means if you are below an ash fall, stay indoors or wear a mask. Going outdoors after ashfall, avoid kicking it up which would reactivate the original hazard. You wouldn't want it in your eyes either, as the particles are sharp.

Ash can carry poisons such as fluorine, and sheep in Iceland have died from eating grass tainted by ash from local eruptions, but this does not affect people directly.

Other problems that ashfall can cause include: stripping leaves from vegetation, building up on roofs until they collapse, and turning into devastating mudflows, called lahars, when the first heavy rainfall occurs.

So far in the current Taal eruption, the eruption column has not exceeded more than about 1km (3,281ft) high, so the ash has not travelled very far.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some residents wore plastic bags to protect themselves from volcanic ash mixed with rainwater

Will the ash and gas from Taal reach the stratosphere? - Mike Rhode

To reach the stratosphere, an eruption column from Taal volcano would need to reach about 15km or more in height, which is the approximate base of the stratosphere at Taal's latitude, only 14 degrees north of the equator.

This may have happened in its 1754 and 1965 eruptions, so it could happen again.

What are the chances of full eruption? - Daniel Reaney

I guess by "full eruption" you mean something like the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo, which lies about as far to the north-west of Manila as Taal is to the south. That measured six on the Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI) scale when the eruption column reached a height of 24km.

The last time Taal had an eruption on that sort of scale was about 5,500 years ago, whereas it had VEI-4 eruptions in 1716, 1749, 1754 and 1965.

So far, Taal's current eruption is much smaller. The authorities have wisely declared a 15km radius evacuation zone, and Manila airport has been closed at times for fear of airborne ash affecting jet engines.

Taal could ramp up to something really big, but it is more likely to continue as it is for a while before quietening down again.

Can eruption of one volcano lead to the eruption of others in this or nearby countries? - Harish Kumar

There is no known mechanism for an eruption at one volcano to set off an eruption at another volcano. Their magma plumbing systems are not directly connected, despite adjacent volcanoes being fed from the same source. The same really powerful earthquake might trigger two very close volcanoes, but that is about it.

Taal volcano, like the other volcanoes in the Philippines, Japan and Indonesia, are a consequence of plate tectonics. An oceanic plate is being pushed (subducted) below an island arc. Melting begins at a depth of about 70km, and the magma, which is the molten rock below the earth's crust, rises up to feed volcanoes.

This is a slow process, with magma taking thousands of years (or longer) to migrate to the surface. A particular volcano will not erupt until there is enough magma and associated gas collected in its shallow magma chamber. Sometimes an earthquake can prematurely set off an eruption that might not have happened for a few more years.

Will the eruption, if this volcano erupts, affect the fires in Australia? - Katherine Gonzalez

If Taal was to have a really big eruption producing a large ash cloud, I do not think it would have any impact on the fires in Australia. An ash cloud from Taal would be unlikely to spread far into the southern hemisphere, even if high-altitude winds were to spread it right round the globe.

That is a shame in this case, because fine ash in the air can lead to extra rainfall, which presumably would be welcome in south-eastern Australia because of the bushfires.</text><tags>Volcanoes, Philippines</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-51056341<category>uk</category><title>Living with ADHD: 'I have the brain of Einstein and the attention span of a toddler'</title><text>Video

A mother who lost her son to cancer said his voice has urged her to carry on with his "legacy".

Laughlin Whiteley died aged seven in 2014 from a relapse of leukaemia after undergoing a stem cell transplant.

Before he passed away, he started a charity with his parents to give out craft boxes to severely ill children staying in hospital.

"I do feel like he's doing greater things," said his mother Andrea Poyser. "He is alive everywhere."

She said a "phenomenal" 700 boxes had now been sent out in his name.

Laughlin, who was also known as Lockey, had the idea for his charity while in isolation during his stem cell transplant at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.

"Craft and art gave Laughlin a project to keep him busy," said Mrs Poyser.

"There are big windows on the isolation ward, and everyone used to walk past and say his room was like an art gallery.

"Creating and making is such a simple thing to do. It breaks the day up and is a lovely thing for parents to do with children.

The family, who now live in Alburgh, Norfolk, prepare the boxes with help of volunteers who wear protective gloves and sanitise every item.

Each contains age-appropriate toys and crafts, and is distributed to bone marrow and stem cell transplant patients in Great Ormond Street and hospitals across the east of England.

Mrs Poyser said the charity, called Unlock a Life for Lockey, had "grown and grown".

"Every time I tried to stop it came back to bite me," she said. "I'd had a baby, we'd moved to Norfolk - but then someone would get in touch.

"My little boy in heaven was saying, 'You've got to keep going'."

Laughlin's former play worker at Great Ormond Street, Amy Crowley, said he was the "most amazing fun", and had "no words to express how grateful" she was for his boxes.

"These children are in isolation for a long time... I have one patient who's been here for a year," she said.

"The boxes keep them busy for a month and they have things like tents which distract them from the fact they are in hospital... and changes their mood.

"So much care and thought goes into each box - it is as though they know the child... they know how much that child needs that box."</text><tags>Family, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Uplifting stories, Leukaemia, Alburgh, Cancer, Children, Inspiring stories, Burnham on Crouch</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51133811<category>technology</category><title>Microsoft makes 'carbon negative' pledge</title><text>Image copyright Microsoft Image caption Satya Nadella said that technology built without principles does more harm than good

Microsoft has pledged to remove "all of the carbon" from the environment that it has emitted since the company was founded in 1975.

Chief executive Satya Nadella said he wanted to achieve the goal by 2050 .

To do so, the company aims to become "carbon negative" by 2030, removing more carbon from the environment than it emits.

That goes beyond a pledge by its cloud-computing rival Amazon, which intends to go "carbon neutral" by 2040.

"When it comes to carbon, neutrality is not enough," said Microsoft president Brad Smith.

"The carbon in our atmosphere has created a blanket of gas that traps heat and is changing the world's climate," he added in a blog.

"If we don't curb emissions, and temperatures continue to climb, science tells us that the results will be catastrophic."

The company also announced it was setting up a $1bn (&#163;765m) climate innovation fund to develop carbon-tackling technologies.

Carbon neutral v carbon negative

When a business says it is carbon neutral, it aims to effectively add no carbon to the atmosphere.

It can do this by:

balancing its emissions, for example by removing a tonne of carbon from the atmosphere for every tonne it has produced

offsetting its emissions, for example by investing in projects that reduce emissions elsewhere in the world

not releasing greenhouse gases in the first place, for example by switching to renewable energy sources

Until now, most companies have focused on offsetting emissions to achieve neutrality.

This often involves funding projects in developing economies to reduce carbon emissions there, for example building hydroelectric power plants, encouraging families to stop using wood-based stoves, and helping businesses make use of solar power. These reductions are then deducted from the main company's own output.

The result of this slows carbon emissions rather than reversing them.

To be carbon negative a company must actually remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits.

Microsoft says it will do this using a range of carbon capture and storage technologies.

The announcement was largely welcomed by environmentalists, who said it showed Microsoft was thinking about the bigger climate change picture and not just its own role.

"It's a hat trick of sustainability leadership," said Elizabeth Sturcken from the Environmental Defence Fund.

"But to really shift the needle on climate change, we need 1,000 other [companies] to follow-suit and turn rhetoric into action."

However, Greenpeace warned that Microsoft still needed to address its ongoing relationship with oil and gas companies.

"While there is a lot to celebrate in Microsoft's announcement, a gaping hole remains unaddressed: Microsoft's expanding efforts to help fossil fuel companies drill more oil and gas with machine-learning and other AI technologies," said senior campaigner Elizabeth Jardim.

Microsoft's plan is still more aggressive than those taken by other tech firms, including Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, which have not made "carbon negative" commitments.

How will Microsoft achieve its goal?

Microsoft has suggested a range of ways it could remove carbon from the atmosphere, including:

seeding new forests and expanding existing ones

and expanding existing ones soil carbon sequestration - a process of putting carbon back into the ground. This could be achieved by adding microbes and nutrients to parched earth, which should have the added benefits of making the soil more fertile and less susceptible to erosion

- a process of putting carbon back into the ground. This could be achieved by adding microbes and nutrients to parched earth, which should have the added benefits of making the soil more fertile and less susceptible to erosion direct air capture - sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, possibly by using large fans to move air through a filter that can remove the gas

- sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, possibly by using large fans to move air through a filter that can remove the gas bio-energy with carbon capture - growing crops and then capturing the CO2 they emit when, for example, they are burned to produce heat or fermented to make fuels such as bioethanol. Negative emissions become possible if the amount of CO2 stored as a result is greater than that emitted during production, transport and use

Tech companies' manufacturing and data-processing centres create large amounts of carbon dioxide.

By one estimate, the sector will account for up to 3.6% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions this year, more than double the level in 2007. And it has been forecast that in a worst-case scenario, this could grow to 14% by 2040.

Microsoft has said it plans to halve emissions created directly by itself and those involved in its supply chain by 2030.

One way the company intends to do this is by increasing the carbon fees it charges its internal business groups.

Since 2012, Microsoft has forced its divisions to set budgets that take account of the cost of emissions created through electricity use, business travel and other activities.

Now that charge will incorporate indirect emissions such as those created by customers using electricity to power the divisions' products.

And since Microsoft cannot avoid producing CO2 altogether, it will invest in technologies to capture and store the gas to reduce the amount in the atmosphere.

Mr Smith said this would involve tech "that doesn't fully exist today".

The firm added that its data centres and other facilities would use 100% renewable energy by 2025.

How do Microsoft's plans compare to rivals?

Software-maker Intuit has also pledged to be carbon negative by 2030.

The Californian company has said it will reduce emissions by 50 times more than its 2018 carbon footprint.

Amazon's Jeff Bezos announced in September 2019 that his company would be carbon neutral by 2040.

His pledge included plans to buy 100,000 electric vehicles for the online retailer's delivery fleet.

Google has launched a set of digital tools to allow cities to track and reduce emissions. The search giant also offsets its own emissions by investing in green projects.</text><tags>Climate change, Environment, Microsoft, Climate change</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-51125250<category>uk</category><title>David Bowie: Unseen footage released by De Montfort University</title><text>Video

As Australia battles unprecedented fires this year, a debate is under way about what is called "controlled burning" as a means to stop fires spreading.

This involves deliberately starting fires under controlled conditions to clear out low-lying flammable material - sometimes called "prescribed" or "hazard reduction burning".

It is not the same as "back burning", which is done as a last resort to try to slow down an approaching wildfire by stripping the ground of vegetation.

Some politicians in Australia have blamed environmental activism for stopping controlled fires because of their impact on wildlife and fauna.

So what is the truth behind these claims, and does controlled burning really work?

What is being said about controlled burning?

The issue is part of a dispute between the Australian Greens and some other political parties.

The Greens say the major parties need to do more to tackle climate change.

Other politicians have hit back, such as National Party MP Barnaby Joyce who has pointed to what he says is the Greens' opposition to controlled burning.

He thinks the practice should happen more frequently to stop wildfires, and that you need to burn off flammable vegetation otherwise you increase the risk of fires spreading.

Getty It&#8217;s not burning because they burnt off - it&#8217;s burning because they didn&#8217;t burn off.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said those "who say they want action on climate change" could be "the same people who don't share the same urgency of dealing with hazard reduction".

But the Australian Greens - who are not in the government at either national or state level - have made clear they support controlled burning if it is carried out under expert guidance.

The Greens told the BBC that these accusations have been made for some years.

"We've never done anything to prevent or even restrict hazard reduction burning," they said.

Does controlled burning work?

Done properly, it can help limit the spread of fires and make it easier to put them out.

But Swansea University professor Stefan Doerr, an expert in wildfires, believes the practice is less effective than it used to be because of the more extreme weather Australia has started to experience.

"It can make a difference for a few years, but I'm doubtful it would make a difference in the current extreme drought conditions," he said.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption This year's fires have been particularly hot and intense

He adds that a particular feature of the recent fires in Australia is that they have spread across the crown or top part of the forest - so removing growth at ground level does not make that much difference.

Also the fires have been hot and intense enough to burn through areas that were already burned, with embers able to travel through the air and ignite areas far away from an active fire.

How much controlled burning has there been?

Australian firefighters have a long history of carrying out this type of burning to reduce fire risk. "They are some of the most experienced and well-trained in the world," says Prof Doerr.

Burning to prevent fires is regulated and carried out by state agencies like the relevant fire service, park authority or environment body.

In areas of special environmental value or near heritage sites, national level permission is needed, according to the Department of the Environment and Energy.

An analysis by ABC News shows that while some controlled burning targets in Queensland and New South Wales have been met, others have not because the weather conditions were not right.

The NSW Rural Fire Service report for 2018-19 reveals that although they exceeded targets for reducing fire hazards in parks and forested areas, they fell short of their targets for local government land, privately-owned land and other areas.

Getty Prolonged drought conditions adversely affected the ability to complete hazard reduction work.

Controlled burning can only be done in cooler, damper weather with low wind speeds, to avoid the fire getting out of control.

In 2015, a fire that was started by the Victoria state authorities to burn off hazardous undergrowth ran out of control, destroying four homes and more than 3,000 hectares of farmland and forest.

Some experts argue there needs to be a review of how money is spent dealing with fire risks in a hotter, drier climate.

Rod Keenan, of the University of Melbourne, who has called for a more integrated approach to land management, says: "A lot of resources have gone into extra fire trucks, hoses and getting volunteers. We're not putting sufficient resources into land management."

So while controlled burning does have its place, it is just one part of a broader strategy needed to combat the more extreme fires Australia now faces.

Apple has revived a licensing relationship with UK-based chipmaker Imagination Technologies.

Imagination said it will allow Apple to access "a wider range of Imagination's intellectual property" in exchange for fees under a new, "multi-year" deal.

It comes about three years after the iPhone maker's decision to break ties disrupted Imagination's business.

Shares plunged and the firm was eventually sold to a Chinese-backed investment firm.

In a statement, Imagination said the new deal would replace the "multi-year, multi-use licence agreement" that the two companies announced back in 2014. Terms were not disclosed.

Founded in 1985, Imagination had been hailed as one of a handful of successful home-grown technology companies.

But its survival was in question in 2017, after Apple said it would end the use of Imagination's graphics processing units (GPUs) in favour of developing the equipment in-house. At the time, the US giant accounted for about half of Imagination's revenues.

Months later, Canyon Bridge, a Chinese-backed private equity investment firm, bought Imagination for &#163;550m, a fraction of the company's former value.

Last month, Imagination announced its latest graphics processing architecture, describing it as "the fastest GPU" ever released.

It was one of the jewels in the crown of the UK technology scene - but the history of Imagination Technologies is a cautionary tale for any business about the dangers of having all your eggs in one basket.

Being a supplier to Apple was the route to riches in the good times. At its peak in 2012, Imagination was valued at more than &#163;2bn. But when the US tech giant went cool on the relationship, everything began to fall apart.

Apple had already started poaching key staff and then a warning in 2017 that it was going to phase out its use of the UK firm's technology sent the shares tumbling. Soon after, it was sold to the Chinese-linked private equity fund Canyon Bridge for little more than a quarter of that 2012 valuation.

Parts of the business have been sold, the workforce has been halved to 850, and Imagination now has a broader range of customers. And now it has settled its differences with Apple, amid speculation that the Californian giant preferred a deal to a court battle over the patented Imagination technology that may still be present in the iPhone and other products.

But with the much bigger chip designer ARM in the hands of Japan's Softbank since 2016, and Autonomy sold to HP in a disastrous deal in 2011, the last decade has not been a cheerful period for anyone hoping to see a UK-owned tech business take on the world.</text><tags>Apple, Companies</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51064369<category>technology</category><title>Researchers: Are we on the cusp of an &#8216;AI winter&#8217;?</title><text>Image copyright YouTube/SciNews

The last decade was a big one for artificial intelligence but researchers in the field believe that the industry is about to enter a new phase.

Hype surrounding AI has peaked and troughed over the years as the abilities of the technology get overestimated and then re-evaluated.

The peaks are known as AI summers, and the troughs AI winters.

The 10s were arguably the hottest AI summer on record with tech giants repeatedly touting AI's abilities.

AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio, sometimes called one of the "godfathers of AI", told the BBC that AI's abilities were somewhat overhyped in the 10s by certain companies with an interest in doing so.

There are signs, however, that the hype might be about to start cooling off.

"I have the sense that AI is transitioning to a new phase," said Katja Hofmann, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge.

Given the billions being invested in AI and the fact that there are likely to be more breakthroughs ahead, some researchers believe it would be wrong to call this new phase an AI winter.

Robot Wars judge Noel Sharkey, who is also a professor of AI and robotics at Sheffield University, told the BBC that he likes the term "AI autumn" - and several others agree.

'Feeling of plateau'

At the start of the 2010s, one of the world leaders in AI, DeepMind, often referred to something called AGI, or "artificial general intelligence" being developed at some point in the future.

Machines that possess AGI - widely thought of as the holy grail in AI - would be just as smart as humans across the board, it promised.

DeepMind's lofty AGI ambitions caught the attention of Google, who paid around &#163;400m for the London-based AI lab in 2014 when it had the following mission statement splashed across its website: "Solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else."

Several others started to talk about AGI becoming a reality, including Elon Musk's $1bn AI lab, OpenAI, and academics like MIT professor Max Tegmark.

In 2014, Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at Oxford University, went one step further with his book Superintelligence. It predicts a world where machines are firmly in control.

But those conversations were taken less and less seriously as the decade went on. At the end of 2019, the smartest computers could still only excel at a "narrow" selection of tasks.

Gary Marcus, an AI researcher at New York University, said: "By the end of the decade there was a growing realisation that current techniques can only carry us so far."

He thinks the industry needs some "real innovation" to go further.

"There is a general feeling of plateau," said Verena Rieser, a professor in conversational AI at Edinburgh's Herriot Watt University.

One AI researcher who wishes to remain anonymous said we're entering a period where we are especially sceptical about AGI.

"The public perception of AI is increasingly dark: the public believes AI is a sinister technology," they said.

For its part, DeepMind has a more optimistic view of AI's potential, suggesting that as yet "we're only just scratching the surface of what might be possible".

"As the community solves and discovers more, further challenging problems open up," explained Koray Kavukcuoglu, its vice president of research.

"This is why AI is a long-term scientific research journey.

"We believe AI will be one of the most powerful enabling technologies ever created - a single invention that could unlock solutions to thousands of problems. The next decade will see renewed efforts to generalise the capabilities of AI systems to help achieve that potential - both building on methods that have already been successful and researching how to build general-purpose AI that can tackle a wide range of tasks."

'Far to go'

While AGI isn't going to be created any time soon, machines have learned how to master complex tasks like:

playing the ancient Chinese board game Go

identifying human faces

translating text into practically every language

spotting tumours

driving cars

identifying animals.

The relevance of these advances was overhyped at times, says ex-DeepMinder Edward Grefenstette, who now works in the Facebook AI Research group as a research scientist.

Image copyright Facebook Image caption Edward Grefenstette is a research scientist at Facebook in London

"The field has come a very long way in the past decade, but we are very much aware that we still have far to go in scientific and technological advances to make machines truly intelligent," he said.

"One of the biggest challenges is to develop methods that are much more efficient in terms of the data and compute power required to learn to solve a problem well. In the past decade, we've seen impressive advances made by increasing the scale of data and computation available, but that's not appropriate or scalable for every problem.

"If we want to scale to more complex behaviour, we need to do better with less data, and we need to generalise more."

Neil Lawrence, who recently left Amazon and joined the University of Cambridge as the first DeepMind-funded professor of machine learning, thinks that the AI industry is very much still in the "wonder years".

Reality check

So what will AI look like at the end of the 20s, and how will researchers go about developing it?

"In the next decade, I hope we'll see a more measured, realistic view of AI's capability, rather than the hype we've seen so far," said Catherine Breslin, an ex-Amazon AI researcher.

The term "AI" became a real buzzword through the last decade, with companies of all shapes and sizes latching onto the term, often for marketing purposes.

"The manifold of things which were lumped into the term "AI" will be recognised and discussed separately," said Samim Winiger, a former AI researcher at Google in Berlin.

"What we called 'AI' or 'machine learning' during the past 10-20 years, will be seen as just yet another form of 'computation'".</text><tags>Google, Artificial intelligence</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42055871<category>world</category><title>US gun debate: Four dates that explain how we got here</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Semi-automatic AR-15 guns for sale in Utah

It's one of the most divisive issues in American society, once again brought to the fore because of a deadly mass shooting.

So what is the basis for the right to bear arms? And what key events have helped shape the debate?

The very beginning

15 December 1791

It makes sense to start with the date the Second Amendment to the US constitution was ratified. Here, 27 simple words set the path to gun ownership in the US.

"A well regulated militia, being necessary for the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."

The fact that the sentence does not make grammatical sense has only added fuel to the debate about what its true meaning is.

Is the key part "a well regulated militia" - meaning that only people who belong to a militia should be armed? And if so, what constitutes a militia in the modern day? In 1791 it represented a group that armed itself against the British army.

Is the key part instead "the people"? And if so, who are "the people"?

It's clear which part of the amendment gun enthusiasts see as most relevant - a sign in the lobby of the National Rifle Association (NRA) Museums in Virginia cuts off the first 13 words and says only:

The Revolt at Cincinnati

21-22 May 1977

The NRA today is a powerful pro-gun lobbying group that fiercely resists gun control efforts and says it has five million members.

It wasn't always the case.

The organisation was co-founded by a former New York Times reporter, William C Church, in 1871 to "promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis".

It was set up by former Union soldiers who fought in the Civil War who had been shocked at the poor level of marksmanship of their fellow Union fighters compared with their Confederate rivals (its first president was Gen Ambrose Burnside, whose facial hair inspired the term "sideburns").

Much of its activity before the late 1970s involved hunting and organising shooting competitions.

But a shift began to happen in the 1960s and 70s due in part to rising crime rates and a growing conservative movement, at the time the NRA was keen to move away from lobbying.

"An increasing proportion of members were buying guns for self-protection," Adam Winkler writes in his book Gunfight: The Battle Over The Right To Bear Arms In America. "The leadership of the NRA didn't understand the importance of this shift and decided that the organization should recommit itself to hunting and recreational shooting."

The result was that during the NRA's annual meeting in Ohio, more conservative elements of the group staged a surprise coup in what's become known as The Revolt in Cincinnati.

They were led by Harlon Carter, the head of the NRA's lobbying arm who had once been jailed for shooting dead a Mexican teenager. After a fraught meeting that lasted until 04:00, the NRA's leadership was voted out and the group's new direction as a fierce opponent to gun control was set.

What are an individual's rights?

26 June 2008

Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Dick Heller, the security guard who helped make history

One of the most significant recent developments in recent US gun law came thanks to a security guard in Washington DC.

The district had some of the strictest gun control laws in the US, barring individuals from keeping a gun in the home. But Dick Heller wanted to be able to take his work gun home to the high-crime area in which he lived.

His case - backed not by the NRA but by a group of libertarian lawyers - went all the way up to the US Supreme Court.

The debate focused closely on what those 27 words in the Second Amendment meant in a 21st Century context. Is it OK for an individual to own a gun if they're not technically in a militia?

Five of the justices thought the DC law should be struck down, and four dissented. A whole new interpretation of the Second Amendment was drawn.

In his majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote: "There seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both text and history, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms."

"This is a great moment in American history," NRA chief Wayne LaPierre said after the ruling on 26 June 2008. "Our founding fathers wrote and intended the Second Amendment to be an individual right. The Supreme Court has now acknowledged it."

While gun sales had already been on the rise in the US for some time, they started to increase significantly in the wake of the DC vs Heller case - in the month the ruling was made, almost 820,000 FBI background checks were conducted; in the same month a year later, there were almost 970,000.

It's worth noting though that the Supreme Court added some caveats.

Justice Scalia wrote: "Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."

The court's opinion, he said, did not mean "longstanding prohibitions", such as "the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings" were now lifted.

#NeverAgain?

Only time will tell whether the shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, is a true turning point in the debate about guns in the US.

But it helped galvanise a new gun control movement driven by young people - one that is not necessarily calling for an end to guns, but for compromise and change.

Students who survived the attack that killed 17 people have demanded an end to gun violence in schools.

Their pleas helped bring about a federal ban on "bump stocks", modifications that enabled semi-automatic rifles to shoot more rounds per minute. And Parkland survivors continue to be some of the most prominent young voices for change on gun regulation.

Other mass shootings have led to change in some states.

After the killing of 26 people in Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012, some states enforced better background checks (the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, however, said more states loosened gun restrictions in the year after the attack).

When 58 people were shot dead in Las Vegas in October 2017 - the worst mass shooting in modern US history - Massachusetts banned bump stocks.

So what may happen now?

"In Newtown, the students were so young they couldn't stand up, but trust me - we are going to be the change," Parkland survivor Alex Wind told the BBC.</text><tags>US gun violence, Gun crime</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51115315<category>technology</category><title>Google's announced timeline for new privacy policy</title><text>Image copyright Google

Google has announced a timeline for implementing new privacy standards that will limit third-party use of a digital tool known as cookies.

Cookies track users' internet activity and allow digital publishers to target advertising.

Tech firms have faced pressure to increase privacy protections amid mounting data breaches.

But analysts say the move gives Google more control over the digital ad market where it is already a major player.

Alphabet - Google's parent company - makes the majority of its revenue from ad sales.

To make advertising more personal web browsers collect small bits of information that allow them to create a profile of the users likes and online habits.

What are cookies?

Cookies are a digital tool that tracks an individual's internet activity. The small piece of data is stored by web browsers like Google's Chrome and Apple's Safari while users surf the internet. They record information like what websites have been visited, items that have been added to a digital shopping cart or information that has been filled into digitals forms, such as names and passwords.

Companies use this to find out about individuals' activities on the internet. Web publishers use them to determine what advertising to target to a particular person.

The new policy known as "privacy sandbox" will mean third-party ad sellers will need to go through Google to get information about internet users.

But critics say that is an advantage that makes the market less fair and safe.

"This presents a core problem from a competition perspective. It is yet another example of Google diminishing ad rivals' access to data for the stated purpose of protecting users' privacy," said Dina Srinivasan, a lawyer focused on competition issues.

Apple took steps to limit third-party access to cookies and increase privacy in 2017 and made further moves last May. Its anti-tracking feature, intelligent tracking prevention, shortens the life span of cookies used by Apple's Safari web browser.

Shares slid

Shares in digital advertisers were down following news about the new rules, which will limit their ability to target individuals.

Google said its new policy would be rolled out over two years. The company announced its plans to limit third-party access to cookies in August 2019, but advertisers had hoped to have more time before it was implemented.

In a statement Google's director of Chrome engineering, Justin Schuh, said the company and advertisers need to build a "trustworthy and sustainable web together".

"Users are demanding greater privacy - including transparency, choice and control over how their data is used - and it's clear the web ecosystem needs to evolve to meet these increasing demands," he wrote.

Cookies have been used by web browsers for more than two decades but recent large-scale data breaches have raised concerns about how much data is out there and who it is available to.</text><tags>Advertising, Google, Apple</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51069190<category>health</category><title>Languages affected differently by brain disease</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The researchers want to study speakers of many different languages

There are differences in the way English and Italian speakers are affected by dementia-related language problems, a small study suggests.

While English speakers had trouble pronouncing words, Italian speakers came out with shorter, simpler sentences.

The findings could help ensure accurate diagnoses for people from different cultures, the researchers said.

Diagnostic criteria are often based on English-speaking patients.

In the University of California study of 20 English-speaking patients and 18 Italian-speaking patients, all had primary progressive aphasia - a neuro-degenerative disease which affects areas of the brain linked to language.

It is a feature of Alzheimer's disease and other dementia disorders.

Brain scans and tests showed similar levels of cognitive function in people in both language groups.

But when the researchers asked participants to complete a number of linguistic tests, they picked up obvious differences between the two groups in the challenges they faced.

'Easier to pronounce'

"We think this is specifically because the consonant clusters that are so common in English pose a challenge for a degenerating speech-planning system," said study author Maria Luisa Gorno-Tempini, professor of neurology and psychiatry.

"In contrast, Italian is easier to pronounce, but has much more complex grammar, and this is how Italian speakers with [primary progressive aphasia] tend to run into trouble."

As a result, the English speakers tended to speak less while the Italian speakers had fewer pronunciation problems, but simplified what they did say.

English is a Germanic language while Italian is a Romance language, derived from Latin along with French, Spanish and Portuguese.

The researchers, writing in Neurology, are concerned that many non-native English speakers may not be getting the right diagnosis "because their symptoms don't match what is described in clinical manuals based on studies of native English speakers".

The San Francisco research team says it now wants to repeat the research in larger groups of patients, and look for differences between speakers of other languages, such as Chinese and Arabic.

"We hope that such studies will advance our understanding of the brain science underlying language and language disorders, raise awareness of health disparities in dementia treatment, and ultimately improve care for all patients," said Prof Gorno-Tempini.</text><tags>Alzheimer's, Language, Dementia</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-44253664<category>uk</category><title>Ex-football stars with dementia 'forgotten' by authorities</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Keith Pontin joined Cardiff City as a youth player. He later played for Merthyr and Barry Town.

A possible link between dementia and football is being "swept under the carpet" by the game's authorities, a leading Welsh psychiatrist has claimed.

Dr Don Williams, who led the first studies into the possible link, said it was a "big problem" in the sport.

The Football Association (FA) says studies so far were "inconclusive" but it wants to understand potential risks.

It comes as the family of an ex-Wales international said former players were being "forgotten" by the authorities.

Former Cardiff City defender Keith Pontin, was diagnosed with dementia aged 59. His family are convinced his condition is linked to his career, which included almost 200 appearances for the Bluebirds in the 1970s and '80s.

His wife Janet, 52, from Pontyclun, said she is proud of his career but said she now "looks back and thinks was it worth it?".

Image caption Keith Pontin was diagnosed with dementia two years ago and can no longer work

They claim the defender was constantly heading the ball and sustained a "number of concussions" throughout his career.

Two years since his diagnosis, Keith, 61 - who has two grown-up daughters - has had to give up work, driving, and even conversations can be difficult.

Janet, who wants the football authorities to compile a register of former players with dementia, said: "Keith is not really the same person that he was, he's here but his personality has changed so much.

"He was a great husband, a great dad, a great laugh".

Image caption Dr Don Williams came across his first football-related case in Swansea in 1981

Swansea-based Dr Williams started studying dementia in ex-players in the 1980s, after the son of one patient asked him if his father's condition could be linked to playing football as an amateur.

His work, which followed 14 players living with the condition until they died, was published as part of a study last year.

"The public should know there is a risk, there is a problem", he said.

The former consultant psychiatrist at Cefn Coed hospital said: "No-one would think if one whacked one's smart phone regularly....that it wouldn't be damaged.

"I think the same must apply for the brain".

He joined calls to stop children heading footballs in Wales, as their brains "shouldn't be subjected to repeated mild trauma".

A new study into the links between heading a football and brain damage, funded by the FA and the Professional Footballers Association (PFA), started at the beginning of this year.

The FA previously said it felt "compelled to commission" the study to "fully understand if there are any potential risks associated with playing the game".

It said previous studies had "proved inconclusive" and the new research "will be one of the most comprehensive studies ever commissioned into the long-term health of former footballers."

Image copyright PA Image caption The dementia suffered by Jeff Astle (right), who died in 2002, brought the issue to prominence

The PFA said the issue had been on its agenda for the last 20 years.

In a statement, a spokesperson said "any concerns with regard to the potential impact on the career of a professional footballer is something which is first and foremost" for the organisation.

"We also provide financial support, advice, and guidance to former members who find themselves suffering as a consequence of any injury sustained during their playing career".

The Football Association of Wales (FAW) said the long-term health of all footballers was of utmost importance.

It said although research could not conclude a definitive link between repetitive head impacts and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), the findings warranted further detailed research.

"The management of sport related concussion has changed dramatically over the past five years with guidance evolving in response to research output and the international Zurich consensus," said a spokesman.

"The FAW fully endorse the Zurich consensus statement on concussion in sport and are committed to implementing these guidelines across all levels of the game."

It said it had produced football specific concussion guidance, which will be launched ahead of the upcoming season.

"This will be provided to all clubs in Wales and accessible via the FAW's website," the spokesman added.</text><tags>Pontyclun, Dementia, Cardiff</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51139939<category>world</category><title>White House 'broke law' by withholding Ukraine aid, says watchdog</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images

The White House broke the law by withholding aid to Ukraine that had been approved by the US Congress, a government watchdog has said.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) ruling comes as President Donald Trump faces an impeachment trial in the Senate related to the withheld aid.

He is accused of freezing aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival.

Ukraine has opened a probe on separate allegations linked to the impeachment.

Why was the aid freeze illegal?

"Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law," the decision by the GAO said.

The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) "withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA)", the ruling continued.

The 1974 Impoundment Control Act says it is illegal for the White House to withhold aid appropriated by Congress. It also says the White House must first alert Congress before it delays or blocked funds, which the Trump administration did not do.

No penalties come with a violation of the ICA. Multiple presidents have been found by the GAO to have violated US laws.

The act does allow the agency to sue to have the blocked or delayed funds released, but that has only happened once in history.

The aid to Ukraine was released in September 2019, more than two months after it was first blocked.

The White House said it disagreed with the GAO's opinion, accusing the agency of trying to "insert themselves into the media's controversy of the day".

Democrats welcomed the ruling, saying it undercuts Republicans claim that the president committed no crime.

In a news conference on Thursday morning, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the White House "broke the law".

What led to Ukraine's investigation?

The ruling comes as Ukrainian authorities began a criminal investigation into whether Mr Trump's supporters were spying on the former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.

The former envoy's movements were being monitored, according to letters, phone records, notes and flash drives obtained from Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian-American businessman.

Mr Parnas is an aide to Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.

Some of the materials - which House Democrats are presenting as evidence in the impeachment inquiry - show Mr Parnas and Mr Giuliani discussing the removal of Ms Yovanovitch, who was fired last May for reasons that remain unclear.

Several text messages from a Republican congressional candidate, Robert Hyde, to Mr Parnas appear to suggest the ambassador was being tracked in the capital Kyiv.

Mr Parnas was given apparent updates from Mr Hyde on the ambassador's location and mobile phone.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Lev Parnas is a Republican party donor and an associate of President Trump's personal lawyer

But Mr Parnas told MSNBC on Wednesday that he did not think Mr Hyde's surveillance talk was credible.

"He was either drunk," said Mr Parnas, "or he was trying to make himself bigger than it was, so I didn't take it seriously".

Mr Parnas said Ms Yovanovitch was removed because she was in the way of a Trump-approved plan to prod Ukraine to announce an investigation into former Vice-President Joe Biden.

Mr Biden is a potential Democratic rival to Mr Trump in the White House election this November.

Ms Yovanovitch has called for an investigation into the messages, which her lawyer called "disturbing".

What else did Lev Parnas say?

Mr Parnas told NBC that he was in Ukraine to put pressure on officials to investigate Mr Biden and his son, Hunter, on behalf of Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani.

He said that President Trump "knew exactly what was going on".

"I wouldn't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the president. Why would [Ukrainian] President Zelensky's inner circle or [Interior] Minister [Arsen] Avakov or all these people or [former] President [Petro] Poroshenko meet with me?

"Who am I? They were told to meet with me. And that's the secret that they're trying to keep. I was on the ground doing their work," he added.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has been a central character in the Ukraine affair

Documents show that Mr Parnas was in regular contact with Mr Giuliani as well as Ukrainian officials.

The files also indicate Mr Parnas was directly involved in trying to have President Zelensky announce an investigation into Mr Biden.

One handwritten note from Mr Parnas states: "Get Zalensky [sic] to Annonce [sic] that the Biden case will be investigated."

Image copyright House Intelligence Committee

There is also a screenshot of a previously undisclosed letter from Mr Giuliani to Mr Zelensky, in which he asks to arrange a meeting.

Mr Parnas said President Trump "decided to" withhold military aid to increase pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens' activities.

Mr Parnas also said he told a Ukrainian official that US Vice-President Mike Pence would not attend President Zelensky's inauguration unless there was an investigation into the Bidens.

Mr Trump has said he does not know Mr Parnas. Referring to photos of himself with Mr Parnas and another Giuliani associate, he said: "It's possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody."

Mr Trump's has touted unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Mr Biden and his son, Hunter, who held a lucrative board position with Ukrainian gas firm Burisma while his father was US vice-president overseeing American-Ukrainian relations.

The matter will be examined in Mr Trump's impeachment trial, which is due to begin in earnest next week in the US Senate.

He is accused of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress but denies any wrongdoing.

Trump gets his Ukraine investigation... sort of

Analysis by Jonah Fischer, BBC News, Kyiv

After months of pressure from the Trump administration, Ukraine has at last launched an investigation. Unfortunately for President Trump it's not the one he's long demanded.

This interior ministry inquiry will not look into the son of former Vice-President Joe Biden or Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company Hunter Biden once lucratively worked for.

It's aimed rather closer to the White House.

Incredibly, Ukraine is looking into whether Trump supporters were involved in illegally surveilling Marie Yovanovitch when she was US ambassador in Kyiv.

At the time Ms Yovanovitch was the subject of a public campaign by President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates to have her removed.

In May 2019 they were successful, with Ms Yovanovitch later testifying to Congress she was recalled at short notice because of an unspecified threat to her security.

There's been no suggestion that President Trump was aware of any plans to monitor Ms Yovanovitch.

But in his July phone call with President Zelensky he said she was "bad news" and that she was "going to go through some things."

At first it seems like a quirky, what-are-the-chances-of-that headline: "China rewards fishers who netted foreign spy devices."

But behind that headline in Chinese state media, there is a different - and more intriguing - story.

Firstly, this wasn't two or three fishermen receiving awards. It was 11 - one woman, the rest men - who found seven devices in total.

Secondly, this wasn't the first time fishermen from Jiangsu had found "spy drones". In 2018, some 18 were rewarded for finding nine devices. There was also a ceremony a year earlier.

And thirdly, the rewards were huge - up to 500,000 yuan ($72,000; &#163;55,000) - around 17 times the average disposable income in China.

So where do the "submarine spies" come from? What do they do? Why are they valuable?

And why are Chinese fishermen finding so many?

Image copyright Weibo Image caption The 11 award-winners in Jiangsu

Jiangsu is a province in eastern China, with a coastline more than 1,000km (620 miles) long.

It faces Japan and South Korea, while Taiwan is around 500 miles south. This geography - and the huge US presence in the region - begins to explain why fishermen keep finding these devices.

China has not revealed where the devices came from, merely saying they were "made in other countries".

But regional expert and consultant Alexander Neill says they probably came from "the US Navy, the Japan Self-Defense Forces, or potentially Taiwan - this is a big area of rivalry".

So what are the Americans, the Japanese, or the Taiwanese hoping to learn?

In 2009, the US Navy sponsored research into underwater drones, broadly known as "unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs)". The research recommended seven ways UUVs could be used, including:

Tracking "potentially adversary submarines"

Looking for and dealing with underwater bombs - particularly in other countries' waters

Deploying surveillance equipment

Monitoring "undersea infrastructure", such as communication cables

The research also highlighted the strengths of UUVs. Gliders - a smaller UUV, likely to be what the Jiangsu fishermen found - can be deployed for "months" and are "cheap enough to be considered expendable".

In this instance, cheap means "only tens of thousands of dollars".

Their cost, range, and capability mean "submarine spies" are increasingly important - Mr Neill estimates the number worldwide is "certainly in the upper hundreds".

So this explains - in part - why they keep turning up in Chinese nets. The country has a huge fishing fleet, and the law of averages suggests it will scoop up the occasional drone.

But it's also true that China's fleet is different to other countries'. Some fishermen, themselves, are part of the military - and understanding how this unique unit works could explain why they keep finding military hardware.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC News looks at how powerful China's military is, compared to that of the USA

The Chinese Maritime Militia is part of the national militia - that is, the reserve civilian forces.

It is "virtually unique and publicly obscure", according to Professor Andrew S. Erickson from the US Naval War College - but it is well-known to the United States military.

According to a 2017 report by the US Department of Defense, the CMM has played "significant roles in a number of military campaigns and coercive incidents over the years".

In the past, the CMM rented vessels from companies or fishermen. But now, the DoD says, "it appears China is building a state-owned fishing fleet for its militia force".

Indeed, Mr Neill says many boats are merely "masquerading as fishing vessels - they're actually doing naval and maritime surveillance against China's rivals".

"On paper they look like sophisticated, modern trawlers," he says. "But they are actually, essentially, military-type vessels - steel-hulled, not wooden-hulled, with increasing tonnage.

"If you look at photographs, it's clear they're networked in - because of their signalling capabilities - with the [regular navy] command and control network."

In effect, the fishing fleet can provide a low-level, first line of defence or surveillance - a military force working under a civilian cloak.

"A very significant swathe of China's fishing fleet is co-opted into the militia," says Mr Neill.

"I would have thought, with a little digging, you would find these guys [the Jiangsu fishermen] may well be part of it."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The HSU001

China doesn't just find underwater drones - it operates them, too.

At the military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the HSU001 was unveiled - a large UUV, possibly capable of launching smaller drones.

And five months earlier, another Chinese UUV was revealed in a less formal way, when Indonesian fishermen caught a "missile" with Chinese markings in the Riau Islands.

"It's not a missile, but a sea drone, which is usually used for underwater research," said police.

Although its origin was not confirmed, experts suspect it was part of China's vast sub-surface surveillance - the so-called "Great Underwater Wall of China".

So, as UUV technology develops, more fishermen - whether in China, Indonesia, or beyond - can expect to find more drones.

"They [drones] are extending the range of surveillance capacity for all of the modern navies in the region," says Mr Neill.

And - as the Jiangsu prize-winners discovered - they can be a valuable catch.</text><tags>China, Taiwan, US Armed Forces, Drones, Fishing, Military</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46746015<category>uk</category><title>Brexit: Farmers call for new law to guarantee food standards</title><text>Image copyright Reuters Image caption Chlorinated chicken is a familiar feature on US shelves but is banned in the EU

Food standards must be protected after the UK leaves the EU, the farming industry has said.

The National Farmers Union said it had heard enough "warm words" from ministers and action was needed now.

Its president, Minette Batters, said any attempt to encourage cheap imports after Brexit in an effort to cut food bills should be "fought to the death".

Environment Secretary Michael Gove said standards should not be "bartered away" in pursuit of short-term trade gains.

In a speech to the Oxford Farming Conference, he also urged MPs to back Theresa May's Brexit deal later this month and warned of "considerable turbulence" for farmers if the UK left on 29 March without a deal with the EU.

The NFU has said a no-deal exit would be "catastrophic" for the industry and could potentially open the UK to goods that are not produced to the high standards of food safety, animal welfare and environmental protection that are the hallmark of British farmers.

It warned that to avoid food price rises as a result of a no-deal Brexit, the government could unilaterally lower import tariffs, encouraging food producers to buy in inferior materials.

"The biggest threat to us, the biggest threat to the environment is we decide to import cheap raw ingredients and add value to them under the union jack," Mrs Batters said.

"That is A1 critical right now. Get that bit wrong and it really will not work."

Campaigners have warned the UK could be forced to allow imports of hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken, currently banned by the EU, as part of any future trade deal with the US.

While Brexit offered a "massive" export opportunity for British farmers, Mrs Batters said there were real risks to the reputation of the industry if import controls were relaxed.

She urged Mr Gove to show leadership by getting guaranteed standards of minimum animal welfare, environmental protection and food "enshrined in some form of legislation".

"At the moment we've had a lot of warm words on standards," she said.

"We've had commitment from various ministers saying that we would not want a trade deal that brought food in produced to lower standards, but the real challenge is how.

"Of course agriculture's always the last chapter in any trade deal to be agreed so we feel it's really important, we don't want anybody lying down in front of a bus...we want it put in writing."

'Consumer uncertainty'

The government's proposals for agriculture after Brexit are contained in a new Agriculture Bill which is currently being debated in Parliament.

Environmental campaigners said it should include plans for an independent regulator to ensure that minimum standards to protect water, soil, wildlife and animal welfare are maintained.

"We can only guarantee long-term food security by protecting and managing the natural assets which enable food production," said its chairman Martin Lines.

"If the government does not amend the bill to include minimum standards - and put a stop to the environmental degradation caused by intensive farming - British farmers will be in danger of losing their livelihoods."

Mr Gove said concerns the UK would have to lower its food standards to access US markets were not new, because they had been raised a few years ago during discussions over the now aborted plan for an EU-US transatlantic trade and investment partnership.

"The two particular foods that were in the headlines were chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-enhanced beef. I have been clear that we do not intend to lower our standards, as that would lead to uncertainty for the consumer and would undermine the strength of our domestic production and the reputation it enjoys."

While there were different ways of providing the assurances that producers and consumers wanted, he said he was keen on exploring more informative food labelling to identify products that were "inappropriate, low quality or potentially unhealthy".

Sheffield Wednesday have launched a season-ticket plan that guarantees fans a seat for 10 years after their next promotion to the Premier League.

The '10-year season ticket', described by the Championship club as "completely innovative", will cost up to &#163;6,400.

Confusingly, the ticket will be valid for a minimum of 15 years.

But the longer it takes for Wednesday to return to the top flight - where they last played in 2000 - the longer the multi-year ticket will be valid.

A limited number of the tickets will be made available - to adults only - with the cheapest priced at &#163;4,550 for the Hillsborough Kop, which is behind the goal, and the most expensive at &#163;6,400 for the two-tier South Stand, which runs along the side of the pitch.

Fans will be able to use the tickets from the start of next season.

Wednesday are currently sixth in the Championship, with a chance of promotion this season, but the club have pledged that even if they go up to the Premier League between now and 2025, the ticket will remain valid until 2035.

If they win their next promotion to the Premier League after 2025, then the ticket will remain valid for a decade from the date they go up, at no extra cost. So, for instance, if Wednesday ended their top-flight exile in 2028, the ticket would remain valid until 2038.

However, the clock on that 10-year period, once activated by promotion to the Premier League, would not be stopped if the club were then relegated back to the Championship.

But what if the club are not promoted in 10 years?

"This makes no difference," Wednesday said. "There is no maximum to the numbers of years outside the Premier League. For example, if we achieve promotion in 15 years, those first 15 years are free and then the 10 years start to count down."

The club also say that there is an option to sell the seats back to the club on a season by season basis.

In addition, they have pledged that the tickets will remain valid even if Wednesday are sold to new owners.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49421235<category>uk</category><title>Farming: The UK's deadliest industry</title><text>Working on a farm used to be about as dangerous as being employed on a building site. But while the number of construction deaths has dropped over the past 30 years, fatalities in agriculture have remained high. Why? And what impact is this having on farmers and their families?

The UK's farms remain a surprisingly deadly environment in which to work. Although construction accounts for a higher overall number of deaths, there are many more people working in construction, and so its per capita fatal accident rate is lower than agriculture's.

According to BBC News analysis of Health and Safety Executive (HSE) data, workers in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector are more than 20 times more likely to be killed at work than the average for all other sectors combined.

About 360,000 people work in agriculture, or 1% of the total workforce, yet the sector is responsible for 20% of all fatal accidents at work.

In raw numbers, this means about 30 farm workers are killed in accidents every year.

In 2017, Peter Fisher, a highly experienced haulier of agricultural goods, was among the casualties.

Peter Fisher earned a living transporting enormous bales of straw. In the months leading up to his death, business was booming - a nearby power station required large quantities of straw to burn as biofuel and Peter was much in demand.

He would either take the bales directly from the fields to the power station or to holding areas where they could be stored safely until needed.

When the accident happened, Jack Fisher, Peter's son, was feeding cattle on a separate farm a few miles down the road.

A popular and fun-loving member of the local community, his father was also an absolute stickler for doing things properly, Jack says, and always made sure his three sons went about their work carefully.

But because Peter was alone when he died - solo working is common in agriculture - the family will never be sure exactly what happened to him.

That weekend, he had decided to put in an early shift so he would be finished by lunchtime and could enjoy a meal out with family visiting from Nottingham. He was up and working at 04:00, loading straw on to the lorry in bales 4ft (120cm) wide, 4ft high and 8ft long.

Sometime between 05:15 and 09:00, Peter was taking the support strap off a stack of bales on his lorry - something he had done many hundreds of times before. He had been shifting straw bales for nearly a decade and had done many similar jobs in the decades before that.

A bale of this size weighs 650-800kg (125 stone) and they were piled four high.

The stack of bales collapsed.

"When they took the bales off him, he had a rolled up ratchet strap in his hand," Jack says. "It was an instant thing - he wouldn't have felt anything."

The consequences were devastating, both personally and financially but Jack's older brother decided to take over the family business in the months of turmoil that followed Peter's death and in the past few weeks has persuaded Jack to join him, taking on a contract for a second lorry.

"There are lots of people who have said to me, 'How can you do a job that killed your dad?' But I think the way to look at it is if you lived your life of 'What if?', then the world wouldn't go round.

"If I didn't feel comfortable doing the job, then I wouldn't be doing it."

Jack talks about how safety-conscious he is at work. He has become a campaigner for farm safety and says younger farmers are improving procedures to make accidents like the one that killed his father less likely.

But the older generation of farmers are not keeping pace. "They feel that because they've done it so long - and they're stuck in their ways," Jack says.

"My dad would probably have been one of those people who thought, 'It won't happen to me.' And that's when an accident catches you. When you think it's not going to happen to you, that's when it does happen."

The farm safety campaign that Jack supports is called Yellow Wellies, which is run by the Farm Safety Foundation. He says it is managing to reach younger farmers, convincing them to take safety considerations more seriously.

"The older generation - they're the people we've got to crack," he says.

An HSE representative said agriculture generally was "an industry in which risks are poorly managed".

"It is a challenge to get parts of this industry, which is characterised by a lack of large companies, to accept that they are not managing risks well," the spokesperson said.

Construction companies, on the other hand, had reduced fatalities in their industry by adopting "demanding targets and action plans, particularly after a summit in 2001".

"The supply chain in construction is often based on large companies employing various tiers of sub-contract specialists who can be directly influenced," the HSE representative said.

Yellow Wellies uses the tagline: "Who would fill your boots?" In Peter's case, Jack says his father would have been "really, really proud" to see his sons taking on the family business and expanding it.

He just wishes he was around to be a part of their success and advises other farmers to become more danger-aware.

"Take your time - slow down, and make sure stuff's done properly, because once you're gone you're gone and that's it, there's no second chance."

There have been anti-government protests in the Iranian capital, Tehran, and other cities after the Iranian authorities admitted they had "unintentionally" shot down a Ukrainian International Airlines plane.

Some of the protesters have been heard shouting slogans against the leadership.

So how strong is opposition in Iran, and what do the protesters want?

Who are they protesting against?

The crowds taking to the streets in recent days have been concentrated in Tehran and other cities such as Isfahan, and comprise mainly university students and others from the middle classes, angered by the deaths of those on the plane.

They have condemned the authorities for not initially telling the truth. But slogans have also been heard against the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and the Islamic regime.

"Lots of them will have known people on that plane as they are students who can afford to travel abroad," says the BBC's Rana Rahimpour.

There is also little sign of these protests concentrating around a particular personality. "It's hard to say there's a single figurehead right now that people can unite around," says Fatemeh Shams, an Iranian professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

What political opposition is allowed?

Iran's system allows for elections, but political groups must operate within the strict boundaries of the Islamic Republic.

In the 2016 parliamentary elections, nearly half of the candidates were disqualified by Iran's Guardian Council, which vets them for their commitment to Iran's Islamic system.

And for this year's parliamentary elections, which are due to be held in February, thousands of potential candidates have again been disqualified, including 90 current lawmakers.

Any candidates from groups opposed to the Islamic Republic, or who want to change the existing system altogether, are not allowed to run.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ayatollah Khamenei sits at the top of the Islamic Republic's political structure

The Guardian Council can also bar any would-be presidential candidates, and veto any legislation passed by parliament if it is deemed to be inconsistent with Iran's constitution and Islamic law.

Ayatollah Khamenei, who is positioned at the top of Iran's political power structure, appoints half of the members of this body.

The Supreme Leader also controls the armed forces and makes decisions on security, defence and major foreign policy issues.

So in practice, the president and the parliament in Iran - even if they support change - have limited powers.

There are also opposition movements who want greater autonomy for ethnic minorities like the Kurds, Arabs, Baluchis and Azerbaijanis.

Some of these groups - like the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan - are armed and have fought for decades against the Iranian state.

Does the opposition have leaders?

There has been a movement pushing for reform in Iran for years, with Mohammad Khatami, the former president, as its figurehead.

In office from 1997 until 2005, Mr Khatami brought in limited social and economic reforms, and put out feelers to Western countries.

More extensive changes, however, were blocked by conservative interests, and Mr Khatami himself has been sidelined - with his movements and access to the media restricted.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Protests in 2009 turned into a major challenge to the regime

In 2009, a major challenge to the regime came after a disputed presidential election, won by hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Defeated candidates Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi challenged the result and became leaders of what was called the Green Movement. Millions took to the streets to demand a re-run of the election, but Ayatollah Khamenei insisted the result was valid.

Tough action against protests

There was a widespread crackdown against demonstrators that year and dozens of opposition supporters were reportedly killed. Many of the top opposition figures were detained. Mr Mousavi and Mr Karroubi remain under house arrest over a decade later.

More recently, there were protests at the end of 2017 and in early 2018 over worsening economic conditions.

High levels of unemployment in some parts of the country had hit the relatively young population particularly hard.

The wealthier middle classes also joined these protests against the handling of the economy by the government of President Hassan Rouhani, who is considered a moderate.

Those taking part shouted slogans against the country's leaders, and calls were heard for the restoration of the monarchy, overthrown in 1979.

Protests erupted again in November 2019 after the government announced it was raising petrol prices by 50% as it struggled to cope with economic sanctions reinstated by the US when it abandoned the nuclear deal the previous year.

The unrest prompted a bloody crackdown by the security forces.

Amnesty International said more than 304 people were killed, but a Reuters news agency report put the death toll at 1,500. The Iranian authorities dismissed both figures. An internet shutdown lasted for some five days, virtually cutting off the country.

A feature of these more recent protests is that they have often been leaderless, and fuelled by grassroots anger over inflation, unemployment and widening inequality.

However, despite outbreaks of unrest, the government has managed to remain in control, using a combination of severe restrictions on opposition figures and repressive actions.

India's capital Delhi is blanketed under a hazardous shroud of air pollution.

City authorities have imposed a car rationing scheme in a bid to bring levels down, but experts believe the real blame lies with crop burning by farmers in neighbouring states.

Delhi is the latest city to try to come up with ways to tackle increasingly dangerous pollutants in the air.

This is what other cities have done in a bid to beat air pollution.

London

When was pollution at its worst?

Thick smog used to frequently blanket the UK capital in the 19th and 20th centuries, when people burned coal to warm homes and heavy industry in the city centre pumped chemicals into the air.

Referred to as "pea-soupers", the most famous of these events was the so-called Great Smog of London in 1952. It was recently dramatised in the first series of the Netflix drama, The Crown.

Cold weather in the preceding days meant people had burned more coal - often of low quality, which released more sulphur dioxide - while inner-city coal power stations added to the haze. An anticyclone then settled over London, trapping cold air under a layer of warm air.

The smog lowered visibility to a few feet and, over four days, is thought to have killed more than 10,000 people.

What was the solution?

In 1956 the UK passed the Clean Air Act.

It regulated both industrial and domestic smoke, imposing "smoke control areas" in towns and cities where only smokeless fuels could be burned and offering subsidies to households to convert to cleaner fuels.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption London used to regularly suffer from thick smog

The act was extended in 1968, and air quality substantially improved in London through the following decades.

What's it like now?

Air pollution remains at hazardous levels in London.

The city recently introduced an Ultra Low Emission Zone, which charges drivers of more polluting vehicles. London City Hall said in October that toxic air pollution had dropped by a third in the six months since the measure came into place.

But the UK capital still has some of the highest pollution levels in Europe. Particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide remain the greatest concern, and thousands are thought to die prematurely every year because of pollutants in the air.

Beijing

When was pollution at its worst?

China's rapid industrialisation brought a huge rise in air pollution.

Coal-burning power stations and a boom in car ownership from the 1980s onwards filled Beijing's air with hazardous chemicals.

In 2014, a report by the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences said the city was nearly "uninhabitable for human beings" because of the pollution.

What was the solution?

Years of hard work.

A UN report this year shows that in the space of just four years, between 2013 and 2017, fine particle levels in Beijing dropped by 35%, while levels in surrounding regions dropped by 25%. "No other city of region on the planet has achieved such a feat," the report says.

But this was because of measures introduced and refined over the course of two decades, beginning in 1998.

Image caption How fine particles known as PM2.5 can affect your health

Since then, the Chinese government has imposed ultra-low emission standards, created an advanced air quality monitoring system, and built more public transport.

What's it like now?

Beijing hasn't entirely fixed its problem. The city still struggles with pollutants - notably the particles known as PM2.5, which are badly affecting Delhi. Commuters in face masks to protect against the poor air remain a common sight.

And numerous cities around China still face pollutant levels far above internationally recommended standards.

But the UN data shows the importance of cutting vehicle emissions, government incentives for private businesses, data transparency, and diversifying the economy away from heavy industry to successfully cut pollution levels.

Mexico City

When was pollution at its worst?

Mexico's capital was infamous in the 1970s and 1980s for its poor air. Just breathing was the equivalent of smoking dozens of cigarettes a day.

Its tens of millions of inhabitants driving across the huge city in hundreds of thousands of cars pushed pollutant levels sky high. The city's position within a high-altitude valley means the poor air is often trapped by a ring of mountains.

In 1992 the UN gave it the dubious honour of being "the most polluted city on the planet".

What was the solution?

In 1989, the city became the first in the world to impose curbs on car usage.

It cut the number of cars on city roads by 20% from Monday to Friday, depending on their number plates. It immediately helped lower pollutants.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mexico's drastic bid to reverse decades of deadly pollution

This was followed by a package of reforms dubbed ProAire, which expanded public transport and imposed stricter vehicle emissions standards, among other measures.

All this helped improve Mexico City's air quality substantially in the years that followed.

What's it like now?

Deteriorating. Studies show some locals ignore the Hoy No Circula programme, or buy second cars to ensure they can drive every day.

The population keeps growing, and spreading out - meaning longer trips in more cars. And those who don't drive often rely on older, less environmentally friendly buses to travel.

In May this year city officials declared an environmental emergency after PM2.5 particle levels rose to more than six times the World Health Organization daily mean recommended limit.

Just as with other cities, Mexico City's experience show there is no easy solution to tackling air pollution.</text><tags>Air pollution, Beijing, Mexico City, Delhi</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51122215<category>world</category><title>German economy sees weakest growth since 2013</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Germany is leading manufacturer of cars

The German economy grew by 0.6% last year, according to official figures, its weakest performance since 2013.

The German statistics office said growth was driven mainly by household spending.

Business investment in machinery and equipment was weaker, however. Exports did grow but more slowly than in previous years.

Industrial production, excluding construction, fell by 0.5%.

The statistics office has not yet published full data for the final quarter of last year, but has enough information to assess the impact on the year as a whole.

Claus Vistesen, of Pantheon Macroeconomics, says growth in the final three months of last year was likely to have been about 0.1% to 0.2%.

That follows very weak growth in the third quarter and a small decline in economic activity in the three months period before that.

Those previous quarterly figures showed Germany avoided a recession last year in the sense of two consecutive quarters of contraction.

But they, and the new figures for the full year, show Europe's largest economy struggling to generate growth.

Car output

Germany is a big exporter (the third largest after two much larger economies, the US and China). There has been a persistent concern that the rising tensions in international trade since President Donald Trump took office would hit Germany particularly hard.

There is some evidence of that in the new figures. Exports did grow, although at 0.9% it was a relatively weak contribution to the economic expansion.

Services and especially construction experienced growth last year, but industry contracted. The statistics office said "especially low output in the automotive industry contributed to the decrease".

Economic activity per person barely grew at all - just 0.1%. Output per employed person actually fell by 0.3%. Employment has continued to expand in German despite the weak growth although the rate of new job creation has slowed.

Unemployment in Germany at 3.1% is among the lowest in the world.</text><tags>Germany, Europe economy, Eurozone</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51112232<category>technology</category><title>Huawei: 'No smoking gun' in US's 5G dossier</title><text>The decision over whether or not to allow Chinese company Huawei to build 5G telecoms infrastructure has been much delayed and much agonised over.

Leaks cost one cabinet minister his job and the matter has divided the US and UK, two allies who are normally tightly bound on security issues.

The difficulty comes because it may well be one of the most consequential decisions that this government has to take. It involves conflicting interests that cannot easily be squared and future technological risks that cannot easily be predicted.

Sensing that the government may be heading towards allowing Huawei to operate in "non-sensitive" parts of the UK 5G network, Washington has intensified its lobbying campaign for the company's exclusion.

A delegation of senior US officials met with UK counterparts and ministers on Monday and presented a "dossier" of information claiming Huawei poses a national security risk.

The US has long contended that allowing Huawei to play a role in infrastructure poses a risk of espionage. Increasing amounts of sensitive personal data will be carried via 5G, including areas like telemedicine. Likewise, the networks will carry more and more machine-to-machine communications, which could expose the activities of business and other organisations, or be interfered with to cause chaos.

Washington has also warned of the risk of sabotage or coercion, asking what happens when an interconnected smart city, including its transport system, is run by a Chinese company.

Sources say the dossier included material about the company's links to the Chinese state - claiming, for instance, that there were serving Chinese intelligence officials who worked for the company and that it received state subsidies through the People's Liberation Army.

There were also allegations of Huawei's role in surveillance within China and of its technology being used to help autocratic governments in Africa spy on opposition figures.

The company itself has always denied many of the claims and said it was "confident that the UK government will make a decision based upon evidence, as opposed to unsubstantiated allegations".

Protected core

The most scrutinised section of the dossier was its technical section.

It challenged the UK's assessment that it could mitigate any risks by keeping Huawei out of the sensitive parts of the network known as its "core". This is where tasks such as checking device IDs, billing and deciding how to route voice and data takes place.

Those who want Huawei excluded argue that as 5G evolves, the current distinction between its core and non-core parts will be lost.

However, UK intelligence officials believe it is possible to design a system architecture in which a larger number of cores are protected from interference.

They have been working with Huawei for over a decade, and believe they have a much better understanding of the real picture. In fact, some of the material the US supplied in its dossier was actually derived from the UK's own evaluation centre which tests Huawei products.

Overall, there was a feeling in London that Washington had failed to produce a smoking gun or anything substantially new.

Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has commented that: "The real question is not looking for a smoking gun but asking whether this is a loaded gun and whether you want to have that risk."

But it seems that the result has been that London's position has not appeared to have moved as it approaches decision day.

Security officials continue to believe they can manage the technical risks but acknowledge there are wider factors in play.

Those include the risk of a diplomatic fall-out with either Beijing or Washington, depending on the decision. That in turn would have implications for trade-deals and investment post-Brexit.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Huawei has invested huge sums into research to gain an edge over its 5G infrastructure rivals - Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung

The UK government is also keenly aware of the economic price of excluding Huawei.

Many of the telecoms vendors want to use its equipment because they say it best suits their needs. Moreover they have already started deploying it.

Ripping it out now would cost billions and, it's claimed, slow down the country's shift to a more connected future.

US officials counter that it will be even more expensive to remove Huawei's equipment when people come to understand its dangers.

Washington's case has been aided by growing concerns about how Beijing is using its power at home and abroad. Even so, UK officials maintain their plans take account of worst-case scenarios concerning what can done through Huawei's equipment.

Spy secrets

If the decision does go against Washington, what will it do? The President and Congress are said to be watching closely.

Much has been made of claims that intelligence sharing could be restricted.

There has been no explicit threat. Instead the language has been more nuanced - talk of reviews to make sure that no sensitive information could be compromised, and steps to make sure sensitive intelligence would be transmitted by other means than 5G.

The head of MI5 has said he does not believe intelligence would dry up. That suggests UK officials think the US may be bluffing.

It is true though that the issue of China has introduced real tension into the normally tight Five Eyes community. Australia has sided with the US over Huawei, whilst Canada and New Zealand have been more equivocal.

The UK may well try and present its decision as a nuanced one - Huawei allowed in but in a carefully controlled manner.

But not everyone can be kept happy. And even when the decision is made, arguments over whether it was right or wrong will not end.</text><tags>Spying, Cyber-security, 5G, Huawei</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-51140119<category>uk</category><title>Scottish FA expected to ban children heading footballs</title><text>Video

The sight of soaring flames, burning trees and scorched earth is becoming a familiar one for people around the world.

From Brazil to Australia, and from California to Indonesia, massive wildfires have torn through vast areas of forest this year. So how do you fight them?

Alexander Held, an expert in wildfires at the European Forest Institute, and Kirsten Langmaid, a firefighter from Australia, talk us through the process.

Step one: Preparation

Alexander: Landowners and the authorities can absolutely take action to better prepare for wildfires.

A top priority should be managing the amount of vegetation a fire can consume. This can be done with machinery or by grazing animals such as sheep or goats. Plus, if a wildfire runs into a pasture area then it will eventually die by itself because there won't be enough fuel.

The controlled use of fire is another option. This involves burning some down some vegetation under carefully managed conditions.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Fire crews work to create control lines - or fire breaks - which are areas free from vegetation. These help slow the progress of a wildfire

In high-risk areas, there should also be control lines that divide up the land and make it harder for wildfires to spread. These can be things like roads, rivers, railway lines or constructed fire breaks. Fire breaks are areas that are free of vegetation.

It's also important for homeowners to make sure their house can be easily reached by firefighters. They need to keep on top of any potential burning material around their home, like gas tanks and fire wood.

Step two: Spotting the smoke

Alexander: Most fire-prone countries have some form of early-warning system in place. These assess the temperature, fuel level, humidity and wind speed. These give a pretty good idea of what the coming days and weeks might look like.

If there's an increased risk of wildfires then extra firefighters are put in place, trucks are prepared and the pilots of firefighting aircraft are put on standby.

If a fire ignites then the first step in fighting it is smoke detection. That can either come from a member of the public who reports it or, in remote areas, cameras and lookout towers that spot it.

In some countries, firefighting aircraft are sent out at the first sign of smoke. But this is different in Europe where they don't tend to be mobilised until three or four days later.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption If it is safe to do so, crews are sent in during the initial response to a wildfire

Step three: First attack

Alexander: This is the first phase of suppressing a wildfire.

Kirsten: We always send a rapid response team out during this first attack. These are crews who are fully kitted out with firefighting gear and water-carrying vehicles.

If the location is a little more remote, then we'll send a plane or a small helicopter up straight away. This is usually just to check it out and they'll give us a rough estimate of how big the fire is.

We use both dry and wet firefighting techniques. The dry method involves creating boundaries around the fire and letting it burn itself out. Either way, we try to contain it as soon as possible. Hopefully during this initial attack.

Alexander: But if you can't suppress the fire in the first hour then you move onto the next phase: the extended attack.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For larger wildfires, firefighting aircraft are used to drop water and fire retardant on the flames

Step four: Extended attack

Alexander: If it gets to this point then you need a lot more resources. The more time you give a wildfire to burn, the bigger they get and the more difficult they become to control.

Kirsten: As soon as the fire passes the first response phase we set up an incident control team. This means we have people back in the office co-ordinating the operation and thinking about the wider strategy.

If the fire is close to a town then we'll throw everything at it. Initially it's just vehicles and firefighters but then we'll move up to fire trucks and then much larger tankers. We use a lot of machinery, like bulldozers, to clear vegetation and create boundaries.

The tactic we use at this point depends on the type of terrain. How we fight a grass fire differs dramatically to how we would fight a pine fire or a tall forest fire. But, generally speaking, it's a two-phased operation made-up of direct and indirect attacks.

We directly attack the flanks of the fire to narrow the front of it. This is often done with water, fire beaters or by digging earth boundaries parallel to the flames. We try to work from the areas that have already been burnt because these are unlikely to catch fire again.

Alexander: But if the fire is too intense and it's not safe to send people and fire trucks in, you move to indirect attacks. This means positioning crews away from the fire and attacking it with aircraft. You can also fight fire with fire by burning down vegetation ahead of the flames.

Kirsten: When we move to indirect attacks we mainly use aircraft to drop fire retardant and water. But as soon as the smoke gets too bad and visibility becomes too poor, we have to bring them back down again. Another form of indirect attack is to dig control lines ahead of where the fire is going.

We work with the police and the army to try and evacuate people and close roads. If it's too late for them to leave, then we'll put out the call to stay and defend. This is when it's actually safer for people to prepare their houses and stay inside.

In a worst-case scenario we would have hundreds of people on the ground, multiple different agencies involved and multiple aircraft in the skies.

Step five: Mopping up

Kirsten: A fire is under control when there's a working boundary around it or we've cut off its head. In other words - when it can't spread any further.

But even when it's under control there's a long process of mopping up and putting out any lasting fires.

Once we've tracked around the whole outside of the fire and it can no longer escape, we come in from the sides and put out any trees that are on fire. This is generally done with ground crews and machinery.

We make sure everything around the perimeter edge is cold. In dry conditions, several days or weeks after a fire, if something is still smouldering and the wind picks up again then a spark could ignite a second blaze. So we take this mopping-up process very seriously.

Step six: Aftermath

Kirsten: Even weeks after a fire has gone cold, we will patrol the area and make sure it's safe. We'll assess whether to open it back up to the public and remove any trees that could fall down and hurt people.

Community rehabilitation is the longest part of the process afterwards. After a major wildfire, the community could still be feeling its impact years later. Post-traumatic stress disorder is an issue and the government here in Australia provides counselling so people can rebuild their lives and businesses.

As firefighters, we try not to get too emotional. You see farms and houses go up in flames that you've been fighting for 10 hours to save. But then you look at an adjacent paddock or a house that you did manage to prevent from burning and it makes it all worthwhile.

US daytime talk show host Wendy Williams, 54, has revealed she is seeking help for addiction and that she has been living in a sober house.

Ms Williams did not offer details about her addiction, but said she had kept her sober house stay a secret from everyone except her husband and son.

She has acknowledged struggles with cocaine addiction in the past.

Ms Williams also leads a non-profit company focusing on drug education, rehabilitation and prevention efforts.

Speaking on her daytime programme, The Wendy Williams Show, on Tuesday, the 54-year-old host said she returned to a sober house every night and has a 24-hour sober coach.

"I have been living in a sober house," she told her audience. "Nobody knew - because I look so glamorous out here."

Each day after filming, Ms Williams said she attended addiction meetings in the New York area to help others, where people "don't know I'm Wendy, they don't care I'm Wendy".

When her appointments are over, her sober coach drives her back to a home where Ms Williams said she lives with "a bunch of smelly boys who have become my family", under a strict curfew of 10pm every night.

The TV personality also brought up her own struggles with cocaine in the past, but noted she had never undergone real treatment for her addiction.

Ms Williams' health was a talking point in 2017 when she fainted on-air. The incident prompted her to reveal that she had been diagnosed with Graves' disease - an autoimmune thyroid condition.</text><tags>United States, New York City, Drug rehabilitation</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50729280<category>world</category><title>Taal volcano: Can we predict eruptions?</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Time-lapse of lightning storm swirling round Philippine volcano

A volcano in the Philippines might erupt "within hours or days", warn authorities.

The Taal volcano has started spewing lava and has released a huge plume of ash, triggering the evacuation of 8,000 people from the area.

So how good are we at predicting when a volcano will erupt and how severe it will be?

A volcanic eruption is when steam or lava is released from a volcanic vent.

It can be notoriously difficult - with devastating consequences - to know when an explosion might happen, especially when a volcano has been dormant for many years.

However, scientists can look for particular signs and trends to make predictions.

They monitor the activity of volcanoes by looking at:

earthquakes

emissions of gases

inflation or deflation of the volcano

If scientists start to see an acceleration of gas from volcanic vents or nearby tremors, for instance, they may start to get concerned about an eruption.

However, predicting whether those signs indicate an eruption will be in one hour, a month or even longer away depends on the individual volcano.

The more data volcanologists have on a specific volcano, the better they'll be able to anticipate its behaviour and the possibility of an eruption.

Most volcanoes tend to show these signs in the weeks or months prior to an eruption but some explosions are much more sudden and unexpected.

It's also more difficult to judge eruptions when volcanoes have been dormant for a while or were active prior to the introduction of modern monitoring technology.

In 1991, an estimated 5,000 lives were saved through an evacuation of the area surrounding Mount Pinatubo, in the Philippines.

On that occasion, advance warnings of an eruption were made by the US Geological Survey and Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.

They monitored the increasing activity from about 10 weeks prior following a series of smaller explosions and alerted the authorities to the need for a major evacuation effort.

It was one of the largest eruptions of the last century.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador erupting in 2016

However in other instances, such as the eruption of Mount Ontake in Japan in 2014, there was no alarm raised because of how sudden it was.

There have also been times when people have been removed from an area unnecessarily - when an eruption didn't actually happen when it was expected to.

But the effectiveness of national volcano-monitoring agencies can vary depending on the level of resources and expertise.

New Zealand is one of the world leaders in this field and assists developing countries such as Pacific island Vanuatu in predicting eruptions. Its most active volcano erupted in December.

The technology it uses to monitor volcanic activity includes GPS (global positioning system) receivers, high-tech sensors and drones, as well as dispatched teams on the ground.

Ben Kennedy, a volcanologist at Canterbury University in New Zealand, says they are "getting better all the time" at making predictions.

"If you compare with earthquakes, we are much better at predicting volcanic eruptions than large tectonic earthquakes," he says.

Apple could be forced to abandon its Lightning connector cable if European lawmakers get their way.

The cable is used to charge and sync Apple devices, including the iPhone.

But members of the European Parliament urged the European Commission on Monday to force tech giants to adopt a single universal charging method.

Apple products do not accept the other two non-wireless types of charger which are available - USB-C and micro-USB, which work on Android devices.

Regulators will vote on the matter on a yet to be determined date, but Apple says the proposed regulation would stifle innovation and be disruptive to consumers.

How likely is this to happen?

If the regulator enforces its proposed regulation, Apple devices sold in Europe would be required to have a new charging method.

It is likely Apple would then adopt USB-C, considering the company's 2019 iPad Pro ditched Lightning in favour of the technology.

A new cable would mark the tech giant's third in 13 years.

The majority of newly-manufactured Android phones already feature USB-C ports.

Why does the EU want this change?

The European Commission has been campaigning for a single charging method for the past decade.

There were more than 30 types of charger on the market in 2009, but that number has since been reduced to just three.

The regulator is determined to cut down on electronic waste being created by obsolete cables, which it estimates generate more than 51,000 tonnes of waste per year.

"This is hugely detrimental for the environment," said European Parliament member Alex Agius Saliba.

"A common charger should fit all mobile phones, tablets, e-book readers and other portable devices."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Apple devices could be forced to use USB-C chargers

Hasn't this happened before?

Apple, along with 10 other leading tech giants such as Nokia and Samsung, signed a memorandum of understanding in 2009.

They pledged to provide micro-USB compatible chargers for consumers.

However, Apple took advantage of a loophole that allowed manufacturers to continue using their own chargers if they offered an adaptor.

Then, in 2014, the EU passed the Radio Equipment Directive, which called for a "renewed effort to develop a common charger".

Apple insisted that its slimmer devices would be unable to fit the then-new USB-C technology, and it claimed it would cost up to $2bn (&#163;1.53bn) to meet the desired standard.

Isn't wireless charging the future anyway?

Apple and many of its rivals, such as Huawei and Samsung, have already released products that charge their devices wirelessly.

Although the technology is in its infancy, new developments have meant that it is now able to compete with traditional charging methods.

Some analysts are even predicting that Apple could scrap its charging ports altogether by releasing future iPhone and iPad models that rely solely on wireless charging.</text><tags>iPhones, Apple, Mobile phones, European Commission</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50962728<category>world</category><title>Australia fires: Death toll rises as blazes destroy 200 homes</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Firefighters in New South Wales sheltered in their truck as it was overrun by flames

Bushfires have killed at least eight people in south-eastern Australia since Monday, while two others remain unaccounted for.

The latest fires, which raced towards the coast this week, have also destroyed more than 200 homes.

Seven people have been confirmed dead in New South Wales and one in Victoria.

Conditions have eased slightly, and a major road that was closed in Victoria was reopened for two hours on Wednesday to allow people to leave.

But many people remain in fire-hit areas. In one town, police dropped off 1.6 tonnes of drinking water by boat.

The seven deaths in New South Wales include:

Two people found in separate cars on Wednesday morning

A father and son who stayed behind to defend their home and farm equipment

A 28-year-old volunteer firefighter who was killed when wind flipped his fire engine

Family members of Mick Roberts, a 67-year-old Victorian missing since Monday, confirmed that he had been found dead in his home in Buchan, East Gippsland.

"Very sad day for us to (start) the year but we're a bloody tight family and we will never forget our mate and my beautiful Uncle Mick," his niece Leah Parson said on Facebook.

The deaths bring the total fire-related fatalities across Australia this season to at least 18, with warnings this could rise further.

Of the homes destroyed in this week's blazes, 43 were in East Gippsland, Victoria, while another 176 were in New South Wales.

Earlier on Wednesday, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said 916 homes had been destroyed this season, with another 363 damaged, and 8,159 saved.

In Mallacoota, Victoria - where thousands fled to the beach on Tuesday - police boats arrived with 1.6 tonnes of water for residents.

They also brought food, a paramedic and medical supplies.

At the same time, police warned people in Sunbury, Victoria - about 40km (25 miles) north-west of Melbourne - to leave the area, as an emergency fire warning was in place.

The smoke from Wednesday's fires was visible more than 2,000km (1,200 miles) away from the South Island of New Zealand, where the haze tinted the sky orange.

Earlier, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said workers would take advantage of the milder weather on Wednesday to clear roads and restore power.

But she said temperatures were expected to rise again on Saturday.

"At the very least, weather conditions will be at least as bad as what they were yesterday," she said.

The New South Wales fire service has warned of dangerous conditions for tourists on the south coast of NSW over the weekend, telling them to leave before Saturday.

Temperatures are expected to reach the 40Cs in the south-east into the weekend, exacerbating already dangerous conditions in fire-ravaged Victoria and New South Wales.

Meteorologists say a climate system in the Indian Ocean, known as the dipole, is the main driver behind the extreme heat in Australia.

The fire service warned they had been unable to reach some people in remote areas of NSW.

"We've got reports of injuries and burn injuries to members of the public," said New South Wales rural fire commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons.

"We haven't been able to get access via roads or via aircraft - it's been socked in [runways have been closed] or too dangerous."

In Mallacoota, many people spent the night sleeping in their cars or on deckchairs.

Victoria Emergency Commissioner Andrew Crisp said - as well as the police vessels - "a large barge" was sailing from Melbourne to the town with food, water and 30,000 litres of fuel.

In Cann River, a town about 80km (50 miles) inland from Mallacoota, residents warned that food supplies were running low.

Further north in Ulladulla, New South Wales, people were queuing outside supermarkets - while cuts to mobile networks and landlines meant people also waited to use payphones.

The military said amphibious ships were setting off from Sydney and would arrive in fire-hit coastal areas of New South Wales and Victoria by Friday.

Meanwhile, a woman from Mallacoota who took a photo that went viral has spoken about the image.

Allison Marion took the picture of her 11-year-old son, Finn, moving their family to safety in a powerboat.

"Finn drove the boat and my other son looked after the dog in the boat and [I am] very proud of both of them," she told ABC News.

When the family returned to land, as conditions eased, they went to check on their home.

"Our street somehow escaped the fire somehow," she said. "However, I feel for many people in our community who have lost their homes.

There have been seven official Democratic debates but this one had a real sense of urgency - in less than three weeks the candidates will face their first test.

The primary season begins on 3 February with the Iowa caucuses, when the Democratic voters in this state will pick who they want to take on Donald Trump in November.

As the six White House hopefuls took to the debate stage in Des Moines, the Republican US president they have in their sights was mocking them at a rally 400 miles east in Wisconsin.

Here are some key moments from the debate - and the Trump rally.

What was the biggest moment?

The body language between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders at the conclusion of the debate - when they spoke heatedly and did not shake hands - told its own story.

The non-aggression pact between the two candidates could be over just as the voting is set to begin.

The biggest news story in campaign politics over the past few days had been the growing tensions between the two most liberal candidates.

Warren had alleged that Sanders told her in December 2018 that a woman couldn't win the presidency - something Sanders denied.

Asked about this during the debate, Sanders denied it again - saying he has long supported the idea of a woman president.

Then Warren had her turn, and in a set-piece response she clearly spent time crafting, she hit a number of political targets almost in one breath.

She started by essentially implying that Sanders was lying. She then pivoted her response into a shout-out for the electoral success that she and Amy Klobuchar, the other woman candidate on the stage, have had. They've won every election they've been in, she said to thunderous applause, while the three male politicians debating have lost 10 between them.

She ended by pitching herself as the unity candidate with a broad coalition.

"The real danger we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who can't pull the party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of constituency," she said. "We need to excite all parts of party, bring everyone in and give everyone a Democrat to believe in."

Given that Sanders has been criticised for being too divisive, Pete Buttigieg for not being able to draw significant minority backing, and Biden for a lack of enthusiastic support, it was a roundhouse kick at the three candidates vying with her at the top of the polls.

What issue divided the candidates?

Due to the last week's Iran crisis, foreign policy for the first time opened the debate - and the candidates fell into two broad categories.

Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders called for US forces to be withdrawn from the Middle East.

Warren said that US generals had been saying for years that the US was "turning a corner" in the Middle East and Afghanistan, but they could never detail exactly how and when the US could get out.

"We've turned the corner so many times we're going in circles in these regions," she quipped, before saying that the US had to stop asking the military to solve problems that could not be addressed militarily.

Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and - somewhat obliquely - Pete Buttigieg came down in support of extending scaled-down US deployments in Iraq. Biden warned that without US troops in the region, the Islamic State group might regain strength.

"They'll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us, with small numbers of special forces we have, to organise the effort to take them down," he said.

When the topic turned to trade, similar divides formed - with a twist. Sanders said he opposed the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement negotiated by the Trump administration, while Warren said she reluctantly supported it as a "modest improvement".

There haven't been too many cracks between Warren and Sanders on policy, but this was one.

The irony, of course, is that recent polls show that a majority of Americans - and Democrats - are in favour of trade deals.

Americans tend not to vote on foreign policy issues outside of times of war or national crisis - but as last week showed, there's no telling when such a moment could arise.

How did Joe Biden do?

Warren may have had the standout moment, but the candidate who could end up emerging the biggest beneficiary of the evening is the one who has managed to bump and grind through the months and still seems in the best position heading into primary season.

If there's a real break forming between Warren and Sanders, it is nothing but good news for the former vice-president. He can keep his head down while his fellow front-runners duke it out - and keeping his head down was exactly what he did on Tuesday night.

Over the course of the evening, Biden once again showed that he's never going to be a master debater. He wasn't when he was in his prime and he seems to have lost a step in recent years. Nevertheless, the smaller debate stage has benefited him. Where he tended to get lost and tired in the lengthy double-digit candidate scrums, he has been more engaged in the past two contests.

When the topic turned to impeachment, he noted that Republicans have "savaged my surviving son" - a subtle reference to the fact that he has buried two children and a wife, a source of sorrow that could generate public sympathy if Hunter Biden gets pulled into Trump's upcoming Senate trial.

After Warren had her moment, Biden got the last word before the commercial break, noting that he has "the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race".

That was a theme he returned to when asked whether he could go toe-to-toe with Trump in a general-election debate.

"I have support across the board," he said, touting his support from black and working-class voters. "I'm not worried about taking on Donald Trump at all."

Then it was time for more commercials.

Once again, Biden got the last word. And his competitors missed out on yet another opportunity to ding the former vice-president before the campaign moves from places like Iowa and New Hampshire to more diverse states, where the breadth of Biden's coalition could give him the upper hand.

Biden's far from a lock for the nomination, but he's keeping his ship afloat - which is more than many thought after his first few rocky debates.

And the Democrats were on Trump's mind

"What these people are doing, they will destroy our nation."

President Trump made fleeting - though biting - references to his Democratic challengers on Tuesday night, speaking at a campaign rally in Milwaukee just as his opponents took the debate stage in Iowa.

Bernie Sanders is "a nasty guy" who is "surging" in the polls, Trump said to jeers and boos, as he addressed a state that voted for Sanders over Hillary Clinton by a 13-point margin in the 2016 Democratic primary.

Trump resorted to well-worn insults to address the other frontrunners: "Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren" and "Sleepy Joe Biden", poking fun at the former vice-president for past gaffes.

And with just these short swipes, Mr Trump said more about the Democratic field than any of his supporters were prepared to offer when asked about his political opponents.

Some described the Democratic field as "fools", buffoons" or "jokes", wasting time on impeachment. But none, they said, pose any real challenge to the president.

"No one can stand up to Trump," Vicky Francis said as she waited in line to attend her 10th Trump rally.

"Everything he said he would do, he has done. He's speaking the truth."

The circular, grey robot vacuum gently bumps against against my feet.

It stops, rotates and follows a skirting board along the kitchen, emitting a loud and unbroken drone.

Throwing out beams of invisible light, it plots obstacles and walls, the narrowness of corridors and the expanses of open areas that it can then - gratefully - accelerate into.

On a phone connected to it, a floor plan of the house is gradually drawn, inch by inch, bump by bump.

As it quietly docks itself in its charger, the floor plan it has built leaves the vacuum and ends up on a cloud server in China.

"We use network analytics to understand where this traffic is sent, and what kind of traffic it is," says Anna Maria Mandalari, part of the Systems and Algorithms Laboratory at Imperial College London that measures how data from your home ends up all over the world.

The lab has also found "smart" bulbs and plugs that tell advertising companies whenever they're switched on or off, and a webcam that sends data, of some sort, to 52 organisations other than its manufacturer.

"I was surprised to see the data going to so many third parties," Anna said, of the devices they'd looked at.

"Of course, people should be worried. If the data isn't being used just for making the device work, then who knows why it's being collected and how it's being used?"

Data doppelganger

This is a story of two business models.

There are, of course, the obvious ones that we know and pay for.

But sometimes there is another business model buried within the services and technologies that we use that is much less visible to us: our personal data is collected and forms products and services that we are at the heart of, but often know very little about.

By law, we all now have a data-right to make a "subject access request" to a company and ask them for a copy of all the data they hold about us.

For my investigation with BBC Click, I decided to try to reconstruct my own data doppelganger - to come face-to-face with myself as I exist in the data, and so to understand a little more about the ecology of exchanges and brokers, suppliers and analytics firms that have built a version of&#8230; well, myself.

I spent more than a month issuing data access requests to as many different companies as I could, around 80 in total.

It was a month spent arguing on the phone, struggling with broken portals and trawling the small-print privacy policies of websites.

Eventually, around 20 companies sent back my personal data, and if printed, it would stretch to about 7,000 pages in length.

I found that there were three different parts to my data-self.

A small amount was composed of data that I'd volunteered myself: my address, name, contact details, and so on.

The second, much larger part was data that I'd generated as I'd used a company's services or products.

But the most interesting was data in a third category: data that had been created from other data that had been collected about me - from models and segmentations, based on probabilities and likelihoods.

Go-getter or disengaged worker?

About 1,500 of those pages were this kind of educated guesswork, all of it from companies I had never heard of before.

It's easy to find data on this scale a little alarming, but most of it I found more silly than sinister:

The age of my boiler had been predicted

My likelihood to be interested in gardening was 23.3%

My interest in prize draws and competitions was 11%

My "animal/nature awareness level" was low

My consumer technology audience segmentation was described as (among other things) "young and struggling".

My household was found to have no "regular interest in book reading" (I have written a book)

At one moment I was a go-getter, an idea-seeker.

Then I was a love aspirer, a disengaged worker, part of a group called budgeted stability or, simply, downhearted.

Something I did triggered a "Netmums - women trying to conceive" event.

If this was a reflection of myself, I didn't recognise it.

A small number of categories were perhaps those that we'd rather people didn't try to guess.

There was the probability that I'd use the internet for gambling or betting, and how much I am likely to spend on alcohol.

Data denied

My greatest impression was how unwelcome I felt in this second world.

We have rights to reclaim our data, but it is far from practical to do so. Some companies did not even respond when I issued a (legally enforceable) request to get my data back.

Several directed me to broken web-portals or online forms for something completely different.

I was made to write "please give me my data back" on a letter, print it, sign it, scan it and send it in.

One company first asked that I use normal post to make the request before I pointed out I didn't need to.

What may happen to things like your floor plan are buried within small-print privacy policies that manage to both be dense and vague at the same time.

When the data did come back, it was often in formats that would be extremely difficult for any normal person to understand.

Whether through design or neglect, learning about this second world is a time-consuming, frequently frustrating process.

And this, really, is exactly the point.

In one business model we are feted as consumers, while in the other we are only the products.

In this sense, these worlds are poles apart even when they both often exist within the self-same devices, technologies and services we all use.

A plan to ban car drivers from taking trips across Birmingham city centre has raised questions about taxis, commuting, electric vehicles and emergencies. So how would it actually work?

What is the plan?

Birmingham City Council wants to cut air pollution by allowing cars to travel into the city but not through it.

Under the proposals, drivers entering the centre would have to go back out to the ring road to then get to other areas.

Our story, which outlined the Birmingham Transport Plan 2031, prompted hundreds of readers to get in touch to ask how the changes would impact on specific drivers and circumstances.

Most of these details were not included in the plan as it was a "draft vision document subject to consultation", a council spokesman said.

Here is how we got on with answering your questions.

What does it mean for commuters?

Commuter car parking will be limited in areas like the city centre that are well served by public transport, according to the document.

"Buses, trams and trains will be the backbone of a new, go-anywhere transport system," it said.

"Sprint [bus] services will deliver high-frequency services on main commuter routes with predictable journey times and dependable timetables," the plan stated.

There will be seven routes and three of them will be in place for the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games.

What about taxis?

Image caption New taxi licensing policies have been introduced ready for the 2020 Clean Air Zone

The only mention of taxis in the plan said those "that meet emissions standards will also make a valuable contribution to the integrated transport system".

Birmingham's licensing and public protection committee had already approved new policies to regulate the number and type of taxis and private hire vehicles it will licence from January 2020, it said.

The council's website said it had funding for 197 charging points for electric and hybrid taxis and private hire vehicles in about 80 locations.

These will start being installed this year in the city centre, at Tyseley Energy Park and at a number of locations around the outer circle, it said.

What about electric cars?

Image copyright Miles Willis Image caption Birmingham's 36 public electric car charging points will be upgraded

The plan said: "Irrespective of advancements in technology, single occupancy private cars will never be able to match the capacity of mass public transport for getting people to where they want to go."

On-street parking spaces would be prioritised for "sustainable forms of transport", it said.

The council plans to replace its 36 public electric car charging points with rapid chargers in more locations starting in early 2020, according to its website.

What about ambulances and people getting to hospital?

Image caption Emergency service vehicles were not mentioned in the plan

Hospital trips or emergency services vehicles were not specifically mentioned in the plan.

However, as the plan prohibits only cross-city trips, patients would be able to drive to a hospital and leave again via the ring road.

Patients would not be able to drive across the city to get to a hospital on the other side, they would have to go around.

What about drivers with disabilities?

Image caption On-street parking spaces would be prioritised for people with disabilities, the plan said

Any decisions over how the plan was rolled out would take into account the needs of motorists with disabilities, the plan said.

The number of disabled parking bays in easily accessible locations would be protected wherever possible, according to the document.

On-street parking spaces would be prioritised for people with disabilities, cyclists, car clubs and other sustainable forms of transport.

"Mobile apps could make it easier, particularly for people with disabilities, to book and pay for transport with a single transaction supporting journeys that combine several modes," it said.

How can I give my thoughts on the plan?

The draft plan is due to go to cabinet on 21 January.

If it is approved by councillors it will go out to public consultation on 28 January until 27 March.</text><tags>Traffic congestion and policy, UK air pollution, Birmingham, Birmingham City Council</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51138859<category>health</category><title>'Alarming' one in five deaths due to sepsis</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sepsis is caused by the body overreacting to an infection

One in five deaths around the world is caused by sepsis, also known as blood poisoning, shows the most comprehensive analysis of the condition.

The report estimates 11 million people a year are dying from sepsis - more than are killed by cancer.

The researchers at the University of Washington said the "alarming" figures were double previous estimates.

Most cases were in poor and middle income countries, but even wealthier nations are dealing with sepsis.

What is sepsis?

Sepsis is also known as the "hidden killer" because it can be so hard to detect.

It is caused by the immune system going into over-drive. Instead of just fighting an infection, it starts attacking other parts of the body too.

Ultimately it causes organ failure. Even survivors can be left with long-term damage and disability.

Bacteria and viruses that cause diarrhoeal infections or lung diseases are the leading triggers of sepsis.

Why the jump in numbers?

Previous global estimates, which came up with a figure of 19 million cases and 5 million deaths, were based on just a handful of western countries.

This analysis, published in the Lancet and based on medical records from 195 nations, shows there are 49 million cases a year.

The 11 million deaths from sepsis account for one in five of all deaths around the world.

"I've worked in rural Uganda, and sepsis is what we saw every single day," said researcher, assistant professor Kristina Rudd.

"My colleagues treating patients on the ground in low- and middle-income countries every day have been saying this for years, that sepsis is a major problem.

"So in a way I wasn't actually that surprised - on the other hand I didn't expect it to be double the previous estimate."

The good news in this analysis is that cases and deaths have fallen since 1990.

The hope is understanding the true scale of the problem will raise awareness and save more lives.

Who is affected?

The overwhelming majority of cases (85%) are in low- and middle- income countries.

Children were most at risk with four in 10 cases in children under the age of five.

But even in the UK, sepsis is a challenge. The death rate is higher than in countries such as Spain, France and Canada.

There are around 48,000 deaths from sepsis in the UK each year, the report shows.

There has been a big push within the health service to identify the signs of sepsis more quickly and to begin treatment.

What can be done about it?

Reducing the number of infections can reduce the number of cases of sepsis.

For many countries, this means good sanitation, clean water and access to vaccines.

The other challenge is to get better at identifying patients with sepsis in order to treat them before it is too late.

Early treatment with antibiotics or anti-virals to clear an infection can make a massive difference.

Prof Mohsen Naghavi said: "We are alarmed to find sepsis deaths are much higher than previously estimated, especially as the condition is both preventable and treatable.

"We need renewed focus on sepsis prevention among newborns and on tackling antimicrobial resistance, an important driver of the condition."

What are the symptoms of sepsis?

In adults:

slurred speech

extreme shivering or muscle pain

passing no urine in a day

severe breathlessness

high heart rate and high or low body temperature

skin mottled or discoloured

In children:

a mottled, bluish or pale appearance

very lethargic or difficult to wake

abnormally cold to touch

breathing very fast

a rash that does not fade when you press it

a seizure or convulsion

Extinction Rebellion protesters have ended a blockade at the entrances to Shell's Aberdeen headquarters.

Activists arrived at the Altens base at about 06:30 and remained at the site until 19:30 in a bid to "hold Shell to account".

The group said the protest was part of its two-week long campaign targeting the fossil fuel industry.

Shell said it was addressing its emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs.

And industry body Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) said climate change would not be solved by "stunts".

Extinction Rebellion also had its purple boat at the site.

The protesters were also in Aberdeen city centre on Thursday afternoon, including at the Union Square shopping centre.

A statement from Extinction Rebellion Scotland said: "Today's successful protest marked the final day of 10 days of action focused on the fossil fuel industry, and in particular Shell's role in driving the climate crisis.

"Thirty activists spent 13 hours blockading the entrances to Shell HQ all day, sending a message that we won't take their wilful avoidance in the face of the climate emergency any more."

The group vowed to continue taking action until governments and industry respond "sensibly and appropriately" to the warnings from scientists and public figures, such as broadcaster Sir David Attenborough.

It concluded: "Anything other than a rapid winding down of the fossil fuel industry is irresponsible and reckless."

One of the protesters, Michael, a 57-year-old management consultant, said: "Governments and corporations like Shell all agree that my children are facing a catastrophic climate and ecological collapse yet are doing next to nothing to prevent this.

"I'm here today because as a parent I am ultimately responsible for the safety of my children whether today, tomorrow or in 30 years time."

A Shell spokesman said: "The heightened awareness of climate change that we have seen over recent months is a good thing.

"As a company, we agree that urgent action is needed. What will really accelerate change is effective policy, investment in technology innovation and deployment, and changing customer behaviour.

"As we move to a lower-carbon future, we are committed to playing our part, by addressing our own emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs - because we all have a role to play."

'Taking action'

OGUK communications director Gareth Wynn said: "Climate change will be solved by practical actions not conspiracy theories and stunts.

"It's disappointing that this group is choosing to disrupt the normal working day of people in this industry, causing alarm rather than engage in meaningful discussion with key decision makers.

"Our industry is packed full of people with the engineering and environmental knowledge and skills to play a key part in reducing emissions and we are already taking action."

Ch Insp Davie Howieson, local area commander for Aberdeen South, said: "Officers are currently in attendance at a peaceful protest in Wellington Road, Aberdeen, outside the Shell premises.

"The road was blocked from around 06:45, and road users are advised to avoid the area for the time being. We are liaising with both Shell and the protest organisers, Extinction Rebellion."

Some women who have recurrent miscarriages might benefit from taking a tablet designed to treat diabetes, researchers say.

A trial in 38 volunteers suggests it helps better prepare the womb lining for pregnancy by boosting certain beneficial cells.

Experts believe some women who miscarry do not have enough of these stem cells.

Cally Cusack, now a mother of two, is one of the women in the trial the drug, sitagliptin, may have helped.

Cally, 29, from Doncaster, did not know until after the study had finished she had been given the real drug rather than a placebo pill.

She had had four miscarriages in the past.

And she and partner, Joshua, had almost given up hope of having their own baby.

"We had got to the point when we did not think it was going to happen for us and we had started looking into adoption," she said.

"But then we were offered the chance to take part in this trial.

"We decided to give it a go.

Image copyright Cally Cusack Image caption Cally, Joshua and their two boys, Dawson and Austin

"We figured that even if it didn't help us, at least it might help somebody else."

After three months on the drug, Cally's stem-cell count in her womb lining had improved. She then became pregnant and nine months later had her first son, Dawson, who is now nearly two.

"Throughout the entire pregnancy, you are on eggshells. I had lost four at various stages, between six and 14 weeks gestation.

"To get to the end and have Dawson - we were absolutely elated. It's the most amazing feeling. I can't really describe it."

One of the researchers, Prof Siobhan Quenby, from the University of Warwick's Medical School, said it was too early to say if the drug could prevent miscarriages - larger studies were needed to confirm that - but the treatment did appear to boost stem-cell numbers in the womb lining to support the placenta, which was "very exciting".

"It basically helps the body to repair itself," she said.

"It's a step towards finding a new cure for miscarriage - and that's why I'm so excited."

Stem cells are immature cells that can become many types of tissue.

And experts believe a lack of stem cells in the womb lining could be causing thousands of women to have recurrent miscarriages - the loss of two or more consecutive pregnancies in the first 24 weeks.

But there are many other reasons why someone might miscarry, including abnormalities in the developing baby. And the drug would not help with these.

Often, a cause is not identified.

About one in four women will experience a miscarriage in their lifetime. One in 100 will have multiple miscarriages. The vast majority of women go on to have healthy babies.

Jane Brewin, from the charity Tommy's, which funded the work, published by The Lancet in the open access journal EBioMedicine, said she hoped a bigger trial in more women could begin soon.</text><tags>University of Warwick, Miscarriage, Stem cells, Diabetes, Pregnancy</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51083515<category>world</category><title>Philippines volcano: Thousands evacuated as Taal spews ash</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Time-lapse of lightning storm swirling round Philippine volcano

A volcano in the Philippines has emitted a giant plume of ash, prompting authorities to order the evacuation of some 8,000 people living nearby.

The plume coming from the Taal volcano, south of the capital Manila, stretched about 1km (0.6 miles) into the sky.

Rumbling sounds and tremors were also reported around Taal - the Philippines' second-most active volcano - on Sunday.

Authorities raised the alert level, warning that a "hazardous eruption" was possible within weeks.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology also warned residents living nearby of a possible "volcanic tsunami", while flights were suspended at Manila's international airport because of the volcanic ash.

Ash began falling in nearby areas on Sunday, with residents advised to wear masks.

A man in the city of Tagaytay, a popular holiday destination, told Reuters news agency he was having lunch when he heard a rumbling sound.

"We saw the volcano erupting. It rained and some small pebbles fell to the ground," Jon Patrick Yen said. "I did not expect to see such spectacle."

Lucy McFadden, a Filipina based in the UK, plans tours for the company Philippine Trails. She said eight tourists and two guides, including her brother, were on a boat returning from the volcano when it erupted.

"About 30 minutes into their journey, the volcano erupted without warning. My brother was so scared because he knew he had a narrow escape," she told the BBC.

The Philippine institute has urged people living around the volcano, located on an island in the middle of Taal lake, and two nearby "high-risk" municipalities to evacuate.

Taal is one of the world's smallest volcanoes. It has recorded at least 34 eruptions in the past 450 years.

For thousands of years, the Indigenous people of Australia set fire to the land.

Long before Australia was invaded and colonised by Europeans, fire management techniques - known as "cultural burns" - were being practised.

The cool-burning, knee-high blazes were designed to happen continuously and across the landscape.

The fires burn up fuel like kindling and leaf detritus, meaning a natural bushfire has less to devour.

Since Australia's fire crisis began last year, calls for better reintegration of this technique have grown louder. But it should have happened sooner, argues one Aboriginal knowledge expert.

"The bush needs to burn," says Shannon Foster.

She's a knowledge keeper for the D'harawal people - relaying information passed on by her elders - and an Aboriginal Knowledge lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).

Much of the ancestral information she shares relates to the bush, says Ms Foster.

"It's the concept of maintaining country - central to everything we do as Aboriginal people. It's about what we can give back to country; not just what we can take from it."

'Naive' techniques of today

Country is personified within Aboriginal culture. "The earth is our mother. She keeps us alive," Ms Foster says. This relationship shifts priorities around precautionary burning.

While modern-day authorities do carry out hazard reduction burning, focusing on protecting lives and property, Ms Foster says it's "clearly not working".

"The current controlled burns destroy everything. It's a naive way to practise fire management, and it isn't hearing the Indigenous people who know the land best.

"Whereas cultural burning protects the environment holistically. We're interested in looking after country, over property and assets.

"We can't eat, drink or breathe assets. Without country, we have nothing."

Indigenous cultural burns work within the rhythms of the environment, attracting marsupials and mammals which Aboriginal people could hunt.

"Cool burning replenishes the earth and enhances biodiversity - the ash fertilises and the potassium encourages flowering. It's a complex cycle based on cultural, spiritual and scientific knowledge."

They also create a mosaic of ecologies, Ms Foster says, and this can lead to beneficial micro-climates.

"Soft burning encourages rain - it warms the environment to a particular atmospheric level, and once the warm and the cool meet, condensation - rain - occurs, helping mitigate fires."

Her Aboriginal elders in Sydney have been assessing the overgrown bush and extremely dry kindling for some time, warning that a huge fire is coming: "They compared it to a kid with unkempt hair, saying it needs nurturing."

But local authorities have forbidden them from cultural burning when they've asked for permission.

Where cultural burning is used

There's no one-size-fits-all approach to precautionary burning because the Australian landscape is so diverse from place to place.

Nonetheless, some states do integrate cultural burning with other strategies, according to Dr Richard Thornton, CEO of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre.

"There's a stark difference in northern Australia, where Indigenous cultural burning happens substantially. In southern states, it's sometimes done according to the needs and wishes of local communities."

Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The bushfire crisis has devastated Australia since September

Since Australia was colonised in 1788, cultural burning was slowly eradicated. But recent years have seen moves to reintegrate it.

Associate Prof Noel Preece, a former national parks ranger, wrote the first fire manual for central Australian park reserves.

He says cultural burning is still practised in parts of Melbourne, but largely stopped in south-eastern Australia because vegetation built up in "precarious areas" where cool burns don't work.

"That said, Indigenous people had extremely detailed knowledge of 'dirty country' that needs a good burn," says Associate Prof Preece, now of James Cook University.

Drawbacks of the ancient practice

Cultural burning, Prof Preece says, can reduce fuel on the ground from 10 tons to 1 ton. But it's only effective protection for moderate fires, so it needs to be done in conjunction with hazard reduction burns.

Even then, it only reduces hazards: "With the recent catastrophic conditions of humidity and high winds, nothing could stop these fires."

"Aboriginal people were taken off their country so there's a re-learning process which is very useful and important. But it's still early days and by itself, it's not enough," he says.

Experts agree that cultural burning has limitations, partly because colonisation led to development and human-created climate change, presenting us with a very different landscape now to hundreds of years ago.

Prof Preece has been in areas where, day after day, the conditions for cooler cultural burning weren't right.

"It'd be too moist, too cool, too hot, too dry - you have a narrow window. And with many firefighters in Australia being volunteers, they're working during the week, and you could go four Saturdays till the conditions are right."

For thicker shrub running up tree canopies, he says a hot burn is required because cool burns won't get rid of such layers of fuel.

In addition, Dr Thornton says individual Indigenous burns, undertaken by specific agencies such as Firesticks, absolutely have their place, but need to fit within community expectations if done on a larger scale by others.

"We need to ensure fire doesn't escape and burn down somebody's property. It'd undermine community views of the entire practice so we need to ensure we operate within a safety framework which is defendable."

The way forward

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has promised a "comprehensive" inquiry into the ongoing bushfire crisis which has so far killed 27 people and scorched more than 10 million hectares.

When it goes ahead, Dr Thornton stresses the need to "talk to Indigenous elders in each different area and listen".

But he says not a single Indigenous person sits on the board of the national bushfire research centre he manages.

Shannon Foster is keen to work together with government agencies, but she worries about expanding development: "It terrifies me that so much land has been decimated, developers could move in and say we might as well put this estate here; the land is cleared."

"Aboriginal people have looked after this place for so long - to see it now destroyed because nobody has allowed us to care for it is devastating," she adds.

2020 Australian Open Venue: Melbourne Park Dates: 20 January to 2 February Coverage: Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra and online; Live text on selected matches on the BBC Sport website and app.

Australian Open organisers are confident the tournament will start and finish on time despite continuing health concerns over Melbourne's air quality from bushfires in the country.

Some players have complained about having to play qualifying matches in smoky conditions.

"There is a lot of speculation about the Australian Open not happening, or starting later," said tournament director Craig Tiley.

"The Australian Open is happening."

Slovenia's Dalila Jakupovic had to be helped off court when she retired from her qualifying match on Tuesday because of the "unhealthy" air quality.

British player Liam Broady said having to play his first-round qualifier on the same day "made his blood boil", adding he was "gasping for air" as he lost to Belarusian Ilya Ivashka.

People in Melbourne were advised to stay indoors and keep pets inside on Tuesday.

A number of players have also criticised the tournament for not postponing the matches, with American Noah Rubin saying he had "blood and black stuff" coming out of his nose following his match on Wednesday.

Tiley says he understands the anger of the players, adding he believes it stems from the confusion of seeing different measurements of air quality depending on the app or website they used.

Dalila Jakupovic said she was "really scared" after she retired from her Australian Open qualifying match because of the "unhealthy" air

Rubin, a former Wimbledon junior champion, also told BBC Sport he was unhappy with the communication from tournament officials, saying they were reluctant to explain the figures to the players.

"Air quality is a very complex and confusing issue which relates to a number of different factors," said Tiley.

"There are number of different air quality measures and it is made more complex by going on an app. There are different apps and websites which give you different readings.

"This is about trusting the medical advice and trusting the expertise and scientific advice of the people who analyse this every day.

"The safety, the wellbeing and the health of the players is the priority for us, as with our staff and our fans."

Tiley said the tournament decided to use a 'PM2.5 concentrate' measure to monitor the air quality levels after receiving advice from environmental and medical experts.

A PM2.5 reading is being taken every four minutes at Melbourne Park. If the reading exceeds 200, Tiley said it would be deemed hazardous and play would be suspended.

He says no reading has exceeded the 200 mark while matches have been in progress at Melbourne Park. However, it did exceed that mark - rated as 'very unhealthy' - on Tuesday, when qualifying was delayed by an hour.

If play is suspended, the Tennis Australia chief executive says the tournament will continue indoors under the roofs on Rod Laver Arena, Margaret Court Arena and Melbourne Arena.

"We do have three indoor arenas in which we can compete. It may look differently but the tournament will happen," Tiley said.

"We are speculating if that would happen but if we had to work it out we would.

"We don't expect that to happen because we haven't yet seen anywhere in the world where there has been above that 200 on the PM2.5 concentrate consecutively over two weeks."

The first Grand Slam of the year gets under way on Monday.

It's the most British of shows, yet this world of Victoria sponges and Bakewell tarts has Americans transfixed. What's the recipe for its success in the US?

It was a Bedfordshire clanger that did it.

Laura Sampson was in her farmhouse in rural Alaska, watching the Great British Bake Off (known as the Great British Baking Show), when the hosts unveiled the contestants' latest task. It was a stuffed suet pastry - half-savoury, half-sweet - a recipe long forgotten by almost everyone in the UK and certainly unknown on the other side of the Atlantic.

"For some reason, that was the bake that got me worked up. I wanted to be in the tent," she says. "That's when I decided to start my own bake-a-long."

Since September, Laura has been running a Facebook group for fans of the series based in the US.

"The Official Steamed School Pudding Thread!" is a sample post in the group, which now has more than 200 members. Laura gives tips on converting measurements in the show to the US equivalents, and then posts a weekly challenge, allowing fans across the country to come back with pictures of their creations.

At first she thought about sourcing a big prize, but then she realised this was not in keeping with the ethos. What Americans often praise about the show is the lack of cut-throat competition or monetary incentives.

As the LA Times once wrote: "Contestants never say things like 'I didn't come here to make friends.' There are no irritating product placements and - perhaps most incomprehensibly to American audiences - no material riches to be won."

Incredulously, it continued: "That's right: The winner of The Great British Baking Show wins a title and an engraved cake stand, and that's it."

A tricky start

The show's introduction into American life has not been straightforward. First, the name had to change, because the Pilsbury company have trademarked "bake off". It was also shown out of sequence, via the PBS network.

And then there was the controversy of the third series of the American version - called The Great American Baking Show and running on ABC - when host Johnny Iuzzini was accused of sexual harassment and the series was pulled midway through its run. Nobody saw winner New York lawyer Vallery Lomas take her prize and she has recently been calling on the channel to air the missing episodes.

To attempt to reboot the American version, Spice Girl Emma Bunton took over as host at the end of last year, but it is the original show that has got the most attention.

In August, it was acquired by Netflix, bringing it to an even wider audience, which has been bingeing it over the winter months.

Many US viewers have said that they decompress watching the show, and they like that it is the antithesis of the nation's fraught politics.

Laura says her baking group is a politics-free zone. "That was the biggest surprise for me. After the first round I felt I had truly found a place on social media that was kind," she says.

Lisa Gorski, a federally-employed microbiologist from San Francisco, can also relate. She has been baking recipes from the show while off work during the government shutdown. "I've been so inspired by the show that I've just been using my time off in the kitchen to try new things," she says. "It is a total escape."'

And if you really want a sense of how people are finding solace in the show, look to former UN Human Rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein. Last year, he gave the most unexpected twist to a hard news story, when he told Reuters that the Great British Bake Off was his release after dealing with world horrors.

"This man pulls out a souffl&#233; just before the competition ends and the thing collapses," he said, recalling an episode. "I burst into tears and I couldn't stop."&#65279;

"I watch them all," says Charles Skinner, a government auditor and drag racer from Maryland, who is a member of the Facebook bake-along group. "The Great British Bake Off, the Great American Baking Show, Zumbo's Just Desserts [an Australian desserts competition]."

He likes the American version, but not as much. "It's less technical. You wouldn't get a bread lion," he says. And he was a big fan of Mary Berry, who presented the original BBC run of the show. "I would love to meet her. She seems so witty."

Image copyright Charles Skinner Image caption Charles Skinner has been inspired by the bread week challenges; this is his cinnamon star bread

He has expanded his own kitchen repertoire through the show. "I live in a remote area and I never know if what I am making is turning out right, so that's why I like watching the judges' reactions." And that's why he joined the Facebook group.

Chrystina Cappello, an engineer from Philadelphia, also wanted to try out the show's recipes alongside others, and she decided to create her own "baking tent" atmosphere by running themed parties.

She started getting a group of friends together - those who bake and those who want to judge. "There was a score card, and the judges would deliberate and talk about why each item deserved its score in each of the categories: level of difficulty, originality, presentation, and taste," she says.

She says it was the camaraderie of the show that won her over. "The producers focus on the moments that the team are working together - when someone helps someone take something out of a pan, when someone has a suggestion on how to fix something, or just gives a much-needed hug. It's endearing, and it's exactly what the world needs right now - more feel-good television."

The original presenters - Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins - are often credited with helping set the tone of the show. They reportedly stormed off set during the first series, accusing a producer of trying to manufacture X-Factor-style drama when a contestant was reduced to tears over a personal issue.

"No one ever cried again," Perkins told the Telegraph. "Maybe they cry because their souffl&#233; collapsed, but nobody's crying because someone's going 'Does this mean a lot about your grandmother?'"

The Great British Baking Show is now part of US culture. The New York Times has run a translation guide. "Stodgy is bad, scrummy is good, gutted is bad," it explained.

Saturday Night Live has spoofed it; The Late Late Show has broadcast its staff bake-off; The Daily Show has used it to explain Brexit, calling it the Great British Break-Off.

The hosts and contestants are becoming household names.

Great British Bake Off contestant Val Stones is a regular visitor to the US, but says she started to get recognised a lot more this year, after the show went up on Netflix.

The retired headteacher from Doncaster has had fans approach her while doing a charity fun run in New Jersey, during a wine tasting in New York State and at a Waffle House in Memphis, among other places.

"My husband says that as we walk through places, such as Tennessee and Kentucky, folk would give me a second glance on hearing my distinct voice, but then think they were wrong," she told the BBC. Lots of people start the conversation with "Do I know you? Do you live on my street?".

And it is that neighbourly familiarity combined with an across-the-pond sweetness - which even the British find unusual - that has made it so popular.

The New York-based Fansided website recently summed up the appeal of the "cheerful little series" following a spat of difficult news worldwide.

"Nobody shared their views on Brexit or gave their opinion on Theresa May. Hardly anyone even mentioned personal hardships [...] All that outside noise, is left where it belongs - outside," it wrote.

"The Great British Baking Show," it concluded, has become "the perfect set of arms to run into".</text><tags>Cooking shows, United States, The Great British Bake Off</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47704194<category>world</category><title>Stolen Picasso portrait of Dora Maar found after 20 years</title><text>Image copyright Tetteroo Image caption Arthur Brand spent four years looking for the painting

A Dutchman known as the "Indiana Jones of the art world" has found a Picasso painting that was stolen 20 years ago.

Arthur Brand says the portrait was circulated in the Dutch criminal underworld for years after it was taken from a Saudi sheikh's yacht in 1999.

Buste de Femme (Dora Maar) was first painted in 1938, and is now thought to be worth &#8364;25m (&#163;21m; $28m).

Dora Maar was Pablo Picasso's lover and muse for seven years. The painting hung in his home until his death in 1973.

Mr Brand hit headlines last year after tracking down a Byzantine mosaic of Saint Mark. It had been taken from a church in Cyprus in the 1970s.

He also won international acclaim in 2015 when he found Hitler's Horses - two bronze statues by Nazi sculptor Joseph Thorak.

The Picasso painting, he told news agency AFP, was circulated for years, "often being used as collateral, popping up in a drug deal here, four years later in an arms deal there".

"Everyone assumed it had been destroyed - that's what happens with 90% of all stolen art, because it can't be put on sale," he told Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant, adding that after he recovered the painting, he hung it on his wall for the night "and thoroughly enjoyed it".

How did he find it?

Mr Brand's search for the stolen portrait began in 2015 after he heard that a "Picasso stolen from a ship" was being circulated among criminals in the Netherlands, although he did not know exactly which work it was.

After several years of searching, Mr Brand worked out that the painting was Buste de Femme (Dora Maar) - also known as Portrait of Dora Maar.

Dora Maar, who was born Theodora Markovitch in 1907, was a renowned photographer and artist in her own right. She was in a relationship with Picasso from 1936 to 1943. She died in 1997 at the age of 89.

The painting had been stolen from Coral Island, a luxury yacht belonging to Saudi billionaire Sheikh Abdul Mohsen Abdulmalik Al-Sheikh, while it was anchored in Antibes for refurbishment.

Once he knew exactly which artwork he was looking for, he was able to put out appeals to people who may have inadvertently bought it. Earlier this month, he got a response.

"Two representatives of a Dutch businessman contacted me, saying their client had the painting. He was at his wits' end," he told AFP. "He thought the Picasso was part of a legitimate deal. It turns out the deal was legitimate - the method of payment was not."

They then brought the masterpiece to his flat in Amsterdam, wrapped in a sheet and some black rubbish bags.

Police in France and the Netherlands have said that they will not prosecute the painting's last owner. It is now being held by an insurance company, which will decide what to do next.</text><tags>Art, Netherlands</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48879379<category>world</category><title>Plane fire: Virgin Atlantic flight makes emergency landing</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images

A Virgin Atlantic flight has made an emergency landing in Boston after a fire broke out on board.

The plane was travelling from New York to London on Thursday night when the fire started, forcing the crew to divert the flight.

No major injuries were reported and all 217 passengers were safely evacuated from the aircraft at Boston's Logan International Airport.

Police believe a mobile phone power bank may have caused the fire.

Bomb disposal officers inspected the aircraft after it landed and found a device between the cushions of the seat where the blaze started.

"Preliminary investigation suggests it is a battery pack consistent in appearance with an external phone charger," a police spokesman told reporters.

That was disputed by one passenger, Maria, who told the BBC she had been speaking to her friend when his seat caught fire. She rejected reports that a phone charger had been the cause.

"It took about two minutes to put it out," she said.

While no-one suffered major injuries, one passenger refused treatment for a "smoke related complaint".

Virgin Atlantic confirmed in a statement that the flight had been diverted to Boston "due to reports of smoke in the cabin".

"Our crew responded immediately and the plane has landed safely", it said,

The airline added that it was investigating the incident to "fully understand the circumstances".

An American Airlines flight also made an emergency landing at the airport earlier on Thursday after a cockpit light indicated an unspecified potential mechanical problem as it approached Boston.</text><tags>Virgin Atlantic, Boston, Air travel, Aviation accidents and incidents</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51112630<category>world</category><title>Plane dumps fuel over schools near Los Angeles airport</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Delta Airlines flight reportedly had to return to the airport shortly after takeoff

A passenger plane has dumped fuel over several schools as it made an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport.

At least 60 people, many of them children, were treated for skin irritation and breathing problems.

Fuel may be dumped in emergency landings, but only over designated areas and at a high altitude, aviation rules stipulate.

The Delta Airlines flight returned to the airport due to an engine issue.

Delta confirmed in a statement that the passenger plane had released fuel to reduce its landing weight.

The children and adults treated following the dumping incident were connected with at least six local schools. All the injuries are said to be minor.

At Park Avenue Elementary School in Cudahy, some 16 miles (26km) east of the airport, two classes of children were outside when the fuel was released.

Elizabeth Alcantar, mayor of Cudahy, told the Los Angeles Times newspaper: "I'm very upset. This is an elementary school, these are small children."

Allen Kenitzer, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, told Reuters news agency: "The FAA is thoroughly investigating the circumstances behind this incident. There are special fuel-dumping procedures for aircraft operating into and out of any major US airport.

"These procedures call for fuel to be dumped over designated unpopulated areas, typically at higher altitudes so the fuel atomises and disperses before it reaches the ground."

Many planes, especially those used for long-haul flights, take off weighing more than their maximum allowed landing weight due to the amount of fuel they carry.

This weight is normally reduced as fuel is consumed during the flight.

But when a flight is cut short the aircraft may still be too heavy to land safely. In such situations the pilot may take the rare decision to dump fuel and reduce the aircraft's weight quickly.

Only certain planes have this capability, and it is done through valves in the aircraft's wings which allow fuel to be pumped out by a specific amount.</text><tags>Los Angeles, United States, Air travel, Aviation accidents and incidents, Delta Airlines, California</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51137470<category>world</category><title>Angola's Isabel dos Santos: Africa's richest woman eyes presidency</title><text>Image copyright Reuters Image caption Isabel dos Santos is one of the wealthiest women in the world

Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos, who is embroiled in a huge financial scandal, has suggested that she may seek to become the country's president.

In a BBC interview, Ms Dos Santos pointedly declined four times to rule out running for the presidency.

Her father Jos&#233; Eduardo dos Santos ruled Angola for 38 years. Prosecutors are seeking to recover $1bn (&#163;760m) Ms Dos Santos and her associates are alleged to owe the state.

She has denied any wrongdoing.

Ms Dos Santos, 46, is one of the world's richest women, with Forbes magazine estimating her fortune to be worth $2.2bn, making her the richest woman in Africa.

Her father controversially appointed her as the head of Angola's state-owned oil firm Sonangol in 2016.

She was sacked from the post in 2017 by President Joao Louren&#231;o, her father's handpicked successor.

What did she say?

In an interview in London, she repeatedly stressed that her life was at risk if she returned to Angola in the current circumstances.

Refusing to rule out the possibility of running for president, she said she had a strong sense of patriotism and duty to her country.

"To lead is to serve, so I will do whatever my life takes me," she said.

Ms Dos Santos later told a Portuguese television channel that "it's possible" she might run for the presidency in 2022.

The announcement marks a dramatic shift for a woman who has consistently portrayed herself as an entrepreneur with no interest in politics.

A court in the Angolan capital, Luanda, last month ordered the freezing of her bank accounts and of her vast business empire in the oil-rich country, following a string of investigations into alleged corruption by the Dos Santos family which prosecutors say has robbed the state of more than $2bn.

"These are false allegations and this is part of&#8230; an orchestrated attack by the current government that is completely politically motivated," she said.

Her half-brother, Jos&#233; Filomeno dos Santos, is on trial in Angola on charges of corruption.

The prosecution alleges that he and his co-accused helped spirit $500m out of the country during his time as head of Angola's Sovereign Wealth Fund. They have pleaded not guilty.

What has changed in Angola?

Ms Dos Santos repeatedly lashed out at President Louren&#231;o, who succeeded her father two years ago as president.

Despite coming from the same party, the MPLA, he has since stunned many Angolans by appearing to target the Dos Santos family as part of a broader anti-corruption drive.

"President Louren&#231;o is fighting for absolute power. There's a strong wish to neutralise any influence that [former] President Dos Santos might still have in the MPLA," Ms Dos Santos said.

"If a different candidate would appear [ahead of the 2022 presidential election] supported by former President Dos Santos or allies linked to him, that would really challenge [Mr Louren&#231;o's] position because his current track record is very, very poor," she added, citing rising unemployment, a stagnant economy and a wave of strikes.

But the allegations of corruption aimed at Ms Dos Santos and her half-brother have been given new weight by the criminal investigations launched against her in Angola.

"The reality is that there is more than enough evidence against her. She's a key figure in the Dos Santos family and a credible threat to Louren&#231;o," said Darias Jonker, a regional analyst for the Eurasia Group, who said that legitimate allegations of corruption were being wielded by the state as part of a vicious power struggle within the MPLA.

"Louren&#231;o is sending a signal that there's a new sheriff in town, with new rules," Mr Jonker added.

"He needs his own patronage network, but his model is much more modest - he won't allow the multi-billion-dollar patronage deals that were a hallmark of the Dos Santos era. Would Isabel support some sort of palace coup? I think it's something she'd certainly consider."

Image caption Jos&#233; Filomeno dos Santos is on trial for corruption

Ms Dos Santos insisted she was being used as a "scapegoat" by President Louren&#231;o, and lashed out at the justice system in Angola, accusing the attorney general of "lying" and of refusing to allow her lawyers to see the evidence against her.

"I regret that Angola has chosen this path. I think that we all stand to lose a lot. A good leader is a prudent leader," she said, calling for a negotiated political solution to end her current legal battles and any further damage to the Angolan economy.

Could she actually win an election?

But could she, or perhaps a proxy or ally, oust the current president and pave the way for a triumphant homecoming?

"I am a businesswoman. A lot of people&#8230; do like me and do understand what I do and do believe in what I do.

"There are thousands of people whom we gave their first job," she said, highlighting her business credentials, and rejecting the widespread perception that she owes much of her fortune to her father's long presidency as "voices that come from the political opposition".

But some observers have been quick to play down the idea of a Dos Santos dynasty with Isabel - derided, for years, as "The Princess" in Angola - filling her father's shoes.

"Isabel doesn't have a strong constituency in her favour inside the party. For now, the party is behind Louren&#231;o, at least when it comes to the targeting of Isabel," said Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, an Oxford professor and expert on African politics.

"If he turns what is still a focused vendetta against the Dos Santos family into a systemic clean-up, the MPLA would not accept it and might even rediscover Dos Santos as the guy who enabled all of them to get rich. But there is no sign of this," the Oxford professor added.

"Dos Santos and Isabel remain deeply unpopular in the country and the party alike. I am not writing her off entirely but she is genuinely weakened by these ongoing revelations and her international standing is deteriorating fast."

With much of her fortune still thought to be intact outside Angola, Ms Dos Santos remains a formidable force.

If she were to seek the presidency - and in the interview, she stressed that her commercial battles were not necessarily best resolved by political manoeuvres - she would first need the law to change in Angola as she is currently ineligible to stand because her mother is Russian.

But those who have watched her remarkable business career, and her furious public assault on Angola's current political elites, agree that such an obstacle is unlikely to prove insurmountable.</text><tags>Angola, Isabel dos Santos</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/51141908<category>sport</category><title>Odell Beckham Jr: New Orleans police issue arrest warrant for Cleveland Browns player</title><text>Odell Beckham Jr was named to the Pro Bowl in his first three NFL seasons

Cleveland Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr is subject to an arrest warrant from New Orleans police on a charge of alleged simple battery.

A video appears to show Beckham Jr striking a security guard's backside in Louisiana State University's locker room on Monday after their national championship win over Clemson.

Beckham Jr, 27, is a former LSU player.

New Orleans police said they had obtained an arrest warrant on a charge of misdemeanour simple battery.

The incident occurred at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans.

In a statement on Thursday, the Browns said: "We are aware of the incident and have been in touch with Odell and his representatives on the matter.

"They are cooperating with the proper authorities to appropriately address the situation."

In another video Beckham Jr appears to be handing out money to LSU players after they won college football's most prestigious prize.

That would be in contravention of NCAA rules, which prevent student-athletes from receiving "impermissible benefits" such as cash.

LSU initially said it believed the money to be fake but quarterback Joe Burrow - who will enter the NFL draft next season - said it was real.

In a subsequent statement, LSU said: "Initial information suggested bills that were exchanged were novelty bills.

"Information and footage reviewed since shows apparent cash may have also been given to LSU student-athletes.

"We were in contact with the NCAA and the Southeastern Conference (SEC) immediately upon learning of this situation in which some of our student-athletes may have been placed in a compromising position.

"We are working with our student-athletes, the NCAA and the SEC in order to rectify the situation."

After a three-year college career at LSU, Beckham Jr was drafted by the New York Giants in 2014 before he was traded to the Browns for the 2019 season.

He recorded 1,035 receiving yards and four touchdowns as the Browns failed to reach the play-offs.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49980327<category>technology</category><title>No-deal Brexit data - should firms worry?</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images

"Take steps now to keep receiving data legally from the EU."

That's the message for businesses in a full page government advert in the Financial Times and elsewhere.

It goes on to warn that after 31 October "you may need to update your contracts."

But just how worried should companies big and small be about handling data in the event of a no deal Brexit?

The advert tells readers to follow the step-by-step guide at gov.uk/brexit.

But when you arrive there, finding your way to the advice about data is not straightforward.

I found that I had to pretend to be a business and answer a whole series of questions before I was presented with the information.

So here is the key issue. Right now data can flow freely across the EU as long as companies conform to its tough new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

And as the GDPR is being incorporated wholesale into UK law, there should be no real change after Brexit - as long as we leave with a deal.

But if there is no deal, we will be treated as an external country, needing what is called an adequacy ruling showing our data protection standards are up to scratch - and the European Commission has indicated that this would not happen in a hurry.

So what do businesses need to do? Well, sending data to the EU will apparently be no problem because the UK government has decided it is happy with European standards.

But if you receive data - perhaps a lists of names and addresses of customers - from a company in the EU or the wider European Economic Area then you will need to take action.

The advice is that you should "review your contracts and, where absent, include Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) or other Alternative Transfer Mechanisms (ATM) to ensure that you can continue to legally receive personal data from the EU/EEA."

Err - right. I can hear dozens of small business owners gulping at that.

But the gov.uk site then sends them over to the Information Commissioner's Office to find a handy interactive tool which will allow them to work out just how to craft one of these clever contracts.

Don't worry, the government site says, "for most organisations, especially SMEs, taking the required action isn't highly costly and doesn't always require specialist advice."

But don't think you can just ignore the problem."If you fail to act, your organisation may lose access to personal data it needs to operate."

Big companies are likely to have addressed this issue. One payments firm told me it had opened an office in Ireland, and was preparing to tell EU customers that their business would now be handled from there.

'Insurmountable bureaucracy'

But how prepared are small businesses?

Ben Thompson, co-owner of a cycle store in Fort William in Scotland, has visited the gov.uk/brexit site.

When he filled in the questionnaire he found he faced 21 Brexit-related issues, among them data transfers.

"We organise cycle tours, and may for instance be getting customer data from a German travel agency," he explains.

He now worries that he may need to sort out new contracts with all of his European customers. "My heart sank when I saw this - it's an insurmountable pile of bureaucracy for a small business."

Legal angle

It is all good business for lawyers. But Alex Brown, head of the technology practice at Simmons and Simmons, urges caution about just how serious the data transfer issue is: "If I was a business exporting this would be on my list to fix - but it wouldn't be near the top."

He doubts whether data regulators will be rushing to punish small businesses which fail to get the right contracts in place straight away.

But it is just one more worry for businesses grappling with Brexit uncertainty.

Make UK, the manufacturers' organisation, says the whole area is confusing for thousands of its members trading with the EU and is calling on the government to give clear guidance.

A DCMS spokesperson said it was in everyone's interests that the exchange of personal data between EU member states and the UK continued, and the government had set out ways in which businesses could comply with EU data protection laws.</text><tags>Brexit, Data protection, Economic effects of Brexit, European Union, GDPR, Brexit</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51133807<category>technology</category><title>'Barnacle' car windscreen clamp sparks student fury</title><text>Image copyright Edward Reali/OU Daily

Plans to introduce a new "barnacle" parking fine system at a US university have been put on hold after complaints from students.

The so-called barnacle is a type of car clamp that sticks to the windscreen using suction cups, and releases its grip after the parking fine is paid.

But outraged students at the University of Oklahoma (OU) shared tips for removing it without paying.

The university's parking authority said it would delay its trial of the device.

"The amount of sheer rage festering in my body right now... this is what I'm in thousands of dollars of debt for? I pay how much to go here and you continue to exploit us in ludicrous ways for profit?" said one student on Twitter.

'Convenient'

The university had originally said the scheme would be more "convenient" for students and less expensive than towing away vehicles.

If a driver had failed to pay more than three outstanding fines, a parking warden would attach the barnacle to the windscreen.

The large plastic screen would be held in place with powerful suction cups, and obscure the driver's view.

Driving off with the device attached to the car would sound an alarm and alert the parking warden.

Students would be able to pay their parking fine in an app to release the barnacle, and then return the device to a drop box in the parking garage.

Barnacle chief executive Kevin Dougherty told the BBC that the device was only used when drivers had parked illegally or failed to pay parking fines.

He said it was not stuck "randomly" on innocent drivers' vehicles, and he said those who had parked illegally would now face the hassle of being towed.

Several students had complained about the planned trial, and said they had found inventive ways of prising off the barnacle from their cars without having to pay.

One poster on social news site Reddit claimed he had been able to extract a mobile network Sim card from one of the devices, and used it to access the internet for free.

Mr Dougherty said improvements had since been made to the design of the barnacle, and said 40,000 had been deployed and returned without incident.

Campus newspaper the OU Daily said the trial had been suspended (link geoblocked in the EU) while the parking team sought "further input from the OU community".

The university had been renting five of the devices for use on campus.

It said students would be given 30 days' notice if it decided to reintroduce the barnacle system.</text><tags>Oklahoma, Parking, United States</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/51132527<category>sport</category><title>Oli McBurnie: Sheff Utd boss Chris Wilder 'relates' to striker but calls for 'responsibility'</title><text>Oli McBurnie (centre in black hat) has scored four goals for Sheffield United since he joined them for &#163;20m in August

Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder says it was "refreshing" to see striker Oli McBurnie supporting Swansea City in their draw at Cardiff despite the striker being warned over his conduct.

Former Swansea player McBurnie, 23, was spoken to by the Football Association after being seen making an obscene gesture during last weekend's fixture.

Wilder says the warning was "quite right" and has also spoken to McBurnie.

"We reminded him that he has a responsibility," said Wilder, 52.

"He's a footballer and with social media and cameras everywhere you can't get involved. He must represent himself, more than anything, a touch better and he understands that."

McBurnie left Swansea to become Sheffield United's record signing during the summer in a &#163;20m move and has scored four times since.

His behaviour at the Cardiff City Stadium was defended by several pundits, with former Manchester United defender Gary Neville insisting the conduct was "the most normal thing I've seen".

Wilder pointed to McBurnie's eye-catching clothing at the fixture by joking he "didn't really go in camouflage disguise" and said he could "relate" to the Scotland striker.

"I have no problem with Oli going back to watch them, he has a big connection there," Wilder added.

"There was a time when I was a player at other clubs, and when I was a manager at other clubs, that I would rush back to Sheffield to go and watch United, or away from home.

"I think it's refreshing that he wants to go and watch games of football. We just had a word with him on the other bit [gesture]. As far as I'm concerned we move on now."</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/51086059<category>sport</category><title>Love Island winner Greg O'Shea on being in the villa, having no regrets and Olympic ambitions</title><text>Professional rugby player Greg O'Shea rose to prominence on reality TV show Love Island

From Casa Amor to Cape Town, 2019 was quite a year for Love Island winner Greg O'Shea.

Or is that professional rugby player Greg O'Shea? Or radio host? Or law graduate?

No matter how you know him, just Greg will do, because that's who he is.

O'Shea's profile sky-rocketed over the summer after winning reality TV show Love Island with Amber Gill, and although their relationship didn't work out in the long run ("it is what is is"), the 24-year-old's popularity has endured.

Before his reality success, O'Shea helped Ireland make history by qualifying as a core World Sevens Series nation for the first time, and despite his new-found fame, rugby remains the Limerick star's bread and butter.

"It's easy to forget that I've been a sports player my whole life, and although people say I'm more of a celebrity star now, my main thing is sport," said O'Shea.

"It was the most unexpected year of my life. I started off the year thinking I was going to do normal stuff, like qualifying as a solicitor and playing with the Sevens.

"We then qualified for Hong Kong, which was my biggest goal from last year, and then Love Island happened.

"It was just bizarre, but I loved every second of it."

Love Island? I thought, 'why not?'

While his relationship with Amber Gill didn't last long after Love Island ended, O'Shea says he has "no regrets" about his experience on the show.

"I didn't actually apply for it," he recalled.

"They found me on Instagram, and I've no idea how because I only had around 1,000 followers at that point.

"They got onto me and asked me if I would do it, and I said 'why not?'."

O'Shea won Love Island with Amber Gill, although the pair went their separate ways a few weeks after the show

O'Shea revealed he was offered a place in the original line-up, but his rugby commitments meant he had to wait until the off-season before entering the villa.

"The last two weeks worked, so I went in and I won it," he recalled.

"The statistics to get into the villa are insane. There's something like 150,000 people interviewed, and 36 go in. That's only like 0.02%.

"The chances of winning are even more ridiculous than that. I do count myself very lucky."

Fame 'was madness'

After his Love Island win, O'Shea became one of the most recognisable faces in the UK and Ireland. So how do you deal with "the madness" of overnight success?

"The key thing for me was that I surrounded myself with my family and my closest friends. That really kept me grounded," added O'Shea.

"It was about taking the right opportunities and sticking to my morals, which I think has gone well so far.

"Honestly, you couldn't have planned it any better with how it worked.

Shannon club man O'Shea made his Irish senior sevens debut in 2017

"The IRFU were so nice for letting me go on, and thankfully it went well for me because it was a bit of a risk.

"My team-mates here cut me at the knees straight away, so that kept me grounded too.

"Everyone has been so supportive and I'm really glad about everything that has come from it."

'One slip-up and you're out'

While the Limerick native is best known for his time in the villa, O'Shea says his biggest success in 2019 was helping Ireland qualify for the World Sevens Series after winning the qualification tournament in Hong Kong in April.

After a tricky debut in Dubai in December, where they finished 12th, Ireland stepped up another gear in the second leg and came home sixth in Cape Town. An impressive feat when you consider it was only their second set of matches as a core nation.

"The word we kept using as a group was 'relief'," said O'Shea on helping Ireland qualify for the first time.

"We had put so much work into getting there and it is a really hard competition to qualify for.

"Only the winners make it, and it is a case of any slip-up and you are out."

On paper, a 12th-place finish in Dubai may not sound like anything to shout about, but O'Shea says Ireland's maiden win over Scotland in their final pool match proved to be a springboard for the following stage in South Africa.

"As a team we probably acknowledged we were a bit tense and a bit stressed with the whole occasion," reflected O'Shea.

"There was plenty of analysis, and we went to Cape Town with a much better mindset. That's a stepping stone now to keep on improving.

"We want to do as well as we can, and if we win one of the stages then that would be amazing.

"We're one of the best teams in the world when it comes to 15s rugby, so we wanted to get the sevens up there with them. Now we are and we're fighting on the world stage."

Olympic qualification 'would be incredible'

After the IRFU set up their sevens programme in 2014, reaching the World Sevens Series capped off a remarkable rise for the sport in Ireland.

"We've been through a lot together now," added O'Shea.

"We've been together for four years, starting in European Division C, right through to the World Series now.

"We're a really tight group of lads and it's a big year ahead."

A big year it is. On top of the remainder of their World Series campaign, Ireland have one last shot at making the Olympic Games with a 12-team qualifying tournament, with the final slot at Tokyo up for grabs.

O'Shea says that Anthony Eddy is the brains behind Irelands rise up the sevens ladder

Tournament hosts France are, at least on paper, Ireland's biggest opposition when it comes to making the Games, and O'Shea says that it would be "a dream" to represent Ireland in Japan.

"The Olympics are the pinnacle of sport, you can't get higher than that," he added.

"Anthony Eddy is the brains behind the operation and he has pulled us all together from all corners of Ireland. I'm not even sure how you would label us as a team.

"I think our journey has brought us tighter, and if we could get to the Olympics then that would be amazing and incredible for the whole country."

'I want to grow the sport'

Perhaps unsurprisingly, O'Shea's popularity outside of sport means he is the most-followed rugby player in the world on Instagram.

That brings pressure in itself, but he feels he can use that to try and promote and grow rugby sevens.

"Most of my followers are people who like reality TV, and I'm trying my best to stick to what got me to that position," he added.

"A lot of people ask me what sevens is. It is exactly what it says on the tin. It is really entertaining sport and I'm hoping my profile can help build it.

Mourners have gathered in Iceland to commemorate the loss of Okjokull, which has died at the age of about 700.

The glacier was officially declared dead in 2014 when it was no longer thick enough to move.

What once was glacier has been reduced to a small patch of ice atop a volcano.

Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir, Environment Minister Gudmundur Ingi Gudbrandsson and former Irish President Mary Robinson attended the ceremony.

After opening remarks by Ms Jakobsdottir, mourners walked up the volcano northeast of the capital Reykjavik to lay a plaque which carries a letter to the future.

"Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as glacier," it reads.

"In the next 200 years all our main glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done.

"Only you know if we did it."

The dedication, written by Icelandic author Andri Snaer Magnason, ends with the date of the ceremony and the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air globally - 415 parts per million (ppm).

"You think in a different time scale when you're writing in copper rather than in paper," Mr Magnason told the BBC. "You start to think that someone actually is coming there in 300 years reading it.

"This is a big symbolic moment," he said. "Climate change doesn't have a beginning or end and I think the philosophy behind this plaque is to place this warning sign to remind ourselves that historical events are happening, and we should not normalise them. We should put our feet down and say, okay, this is gone, this is significant."

Oddur Sigurdsson is the glaciologist at the Icelandic Meteorological Office who pronounced Okjokull's death in 2014.

He has been taking photographs of the country's glaciers for the past 50 years, and noticed in 2003 that snow was melting before it could accumulate on Okjokull.

"Eventually I thought it was so low that I wanted to go up there and check myself. I did that in 2014," he said. "The glacier was not moving - it was not thick enough to stay alive. We call that dead ice."

The glaciologist explains that when enough ice builds up, the pressure forces the whole mass to move.

"That's where the limit is between a glacier and not a glacier," he says. "It needs to be 40 to 50 metres thick to reach that pressure limit."

An Icelandic broadcaster accompanied Mr Sigurdsson to the glacier in 2014 to report the death of Okjokull. But the glaciologist says it "did not stir up very much attention".

"I was a little surprised because this glacier was visible from densely inhabited areas and a good part of the Icelandic ring road," he said. "It was also known to most kids because of its peculiar name and place on maps."

Enter anthropologists Cymene Howe and Dominic Boyer. The two professors from Rice University in Texas made a documentary about the loss of the glacier called Not Ok in 2018, and came up with the idea of a memorial during filming.

"Here was this really important story about this glacier that tells us something about the catastrophic changes we're seeing all around glacial basins everywhere on the planet and yet the story wasn't very well known," Dr Howe told the BBC. "So part of the reason we wanted to make the movie was to get some more visibility for the phenomenon. And the plaque kind of followed in those footsteps."

Image copyright Josh Okun Image caption Dominic Boyer, Cymene Howe and their student Magnus Sigurdsson climbed into the mountains earlier in the week to drill holes for the plaque

"People felt this was a real loss, and that it deserved some kind of memorial," Dr Boyer said. "Plaques recognise things that humans have done, accomplishments, great events. The passing of a glacier is also a human accomplishment - if a very dubious one - in that it is anthropogenic climate change that drove this glacier to melt.

"It's not the first glacier in the world to melt - there have been many others, certainly many smaller glacial masses - but now that glaciers the size of Ok are beginning to disappear, it won't be long before the big glaciers, the ones whose names are well recognised, will come under threat."

Glaciers have great cultural significance in Iceland and beyond. Snaefellsjokull, a glacier-capped volcano in the west of the country, is where characters in Jules Verne's science fiction novel Journey to the Centre of the Earth found a passage to the core of the planet. That glacier is now also receding.

"My generation had to learn by heart the names of the most significant mountains, moors, fjords," Mr Magnason explained. "So culturally it's also referring back to childhood textbooks.

"The world that we learned how it was, learned by heart as some kind of eternal fact, is not a fact any more."

Mr Sigurdsson made an inventory of Icelandic glaciers in the year 2000, finding there were just over 300 scattered across the island. By 2017, 56 of the smaller glaciers had disappeared.

"150 years ago no Icelander would have bothered the least to see all the glaciers disappear," he said, as they advanced over farmlands and flooded whole areas with melt waters and streams. "But since then, while the glaciers were retreating, they are looked at as a beautiful thing, which they definitely are.

"The oldest Icelandic glaciers contain the entire history of the Icelandic nation," he added. "We need to retrieve that history before they disappear."</text><tags>Climate change, Iceland, Reykjavik, Katr&#237;n Jakobsd&#243;ttir , Climate change</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/51141902<category>sport</category><title>Tokyo 2020: Mark Cavendish likely to miss Olympics spot after World Cup omission</title><text>Mark Cavendish has funded his own track race programme this winter

Mark Cavendish looks set to miss out on a track spot at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics after he was not selected for the final World Cup event of the season.

Cavendish, 34, was hoping to race in the madison as the event returns to the Olympic programme this year.

He still needs to race a World Cup event or the world championships next month to be eligible for the Olympics.

British Cycling has chosen Ollie Wood and Ethan Hayter for the men's endurance events in Canada this month.

The sixth round of the World Cup takes place in Milton from 24-26 January.

Cavendish, who is a three-time madison world champion, won silver in the omnium at the Rio 2016 Games.

He has combined training on the road with racing in track events this winter and reached the target of 250 qualifying points at a race in Switzerland last month but has not been called up by British Cycling for a World Cup event.

Cavendish could yet appeal for special dispensation to race but British Cycling head coach Iain Dyer has previously said they may not take a madison specialist to Tokyo in order to take a rider who can also race the team pursuit.

The five-man endurance teams at the Olympics must cover all the pursuit and bunch racing events, though Cavendish was taken to Rio as the fifth man.

The Manxman has joined Bahrain-McLaren on the road for 2020 and will start his season at one-day classic Milan-San Remo, which he won in 2009.

He is likely to target the Tour de France and attempt to add to his 30 stage wins as he looks to break Eddy Merckx's record of 34.

Cavendish, who was affected by the Epstein-Barr virus over the past two years, was left out of the 2019 Tour by former team Dimension Data.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/baseball/51143649<category>sport</category><title>Carlos Beltran steps down as New York Mets manager over 'sign-stealing' role</title><text>Carlos Beltran retired from playing after winning the 2017 World Series with the Astros

Carlos Beltran has stepped down as New York Mets manager because of his role in the "sign-stealing" scandal during his time as a Houston Astros player.

Former outfielder Beltran, 42, won the 2017 World Series with the Astros.

He was named in a Major League Baseball (MLB) report that found Houston illegally used a camera to steal signs from catchers to pitchers that season.

Beltran was not punished as he was a player at the time but has now left the Mets before taking charge of a game.

"We agreed this decision is in the best interest of the team," said Beltran, who was appointed in November.

"I couldn't let myself be a distraction for the team. I wish the entire organisation success in the future."

Mets chief operating officer Jeff Wilson and general manager Brodie van Wagenen said the team and Beltran had "agreed to mutually part ways".

"It became clear to all parties that it was not in anyone's best interest for Carlos to move forward as manager," they added in a statement.

"We believe that Carlos was honest and forthcoming with us and we are confident that this will not be the final chapter in his baseball career."

MLB suspended Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager AJ Hinch for a year without pay for their role in the scandal, and the pair were subsequently fired by team owner Jim Crane.

The Astros were also fined $5m (&#163;3.8m), and made to surrender draft picks.

The Boston Red Sox sacked manager Alex Cora on Wednesday after the investigation found he played a key role in the sign-stealing during his time as the Astros bench coach.

Cora subsequently managed the Red Sox to a World Series victory in 2018 and the team are subject to a separate MLB investigation that they used video replays to steal signs during that season.

What is 'sign stealing'?

It happens when teams monitor what finger signs a catcher is using to request specific deliveries - such as a fastball, curveball or slider - from his pitcher.

MLB rules prohibit the use of electronic equipment to steal signs but otherwise the practice, while frowned upon, is not against the rules.

A report in The Athletic claimed the Astros would monitor catchers' signals via a camera in the outfield, before banging on a rubbish bin inside the clubhouse to signal to the batter that an off-speed pitch was expected.

A subsequent story, also in The Athletic, alleged that Boston players had visited their video replay room, before relaying information to team-mates on the field.

Back in September 2017, the Red Sox were fined by MLB for using an Apple Watch to steal signs from the New York Yankees.

After that incident, MLB issued a specific warning to all 30 teams over technology.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51029492<category>technology</category><title>CES 2020: Manta5's electric bike rides on water</title><text>Video

The US House of Representatives has voted to impeach President Donald Trump.

Mr Trump is accused of pressuring Ukraine to dig up damaging information on one of his main Democratic challengers for the presidency in 2020, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter.

The impeachment process kicked off in September after a formal complaint from a whistleblower - an unnamed intelligence official who wrote a letter expressing concern about Mr Trump's 25 July call with President Volodymyr Zelensky.

A rough transcript of the call revealed that President Trump had urged President Zelensky to investigate discredited allegations against Mr Biden and his son.

President Trump, who is a Republican, strongly denies any wrongdoing.

Ajinomoto, a Japanese company, is not a household name in the West - but a product it makes, monosodium glutamate, is notorious.

Commonly referred to as MSG, the flavouring agent conjures up images of greasy meals followed by headaches.

Now Ajinomoto has launched a campaign to recover MSG's reputation by taking on an unlikely target - Merriam-Webster's Dictionary.

The publisher is being pressed to change "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome".

The dictionary entry is racist and unscientific, says Ajinomoto, and unfairly vilifies MSG.

A campaign video featuring Asian-American celebrities declaring that "MSG is delicious" and urging an edit has helped prompt the publisher to say it will reconsider.

What is 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome'?

Tucked between "Chinese red" and "Chinese rose", the disputed entry in Merriam-Webster's is defined as:

"A group of symptoms (such as numbness of the neck, arms, and back with headache, dizziness, and palpitations) that is held to affect susceptible persons eating food and especially Chinese food heavily seasoned with monosodium glutamate."

It first appeared in the reference book in 1993, but entered American parlance decades earlier.

The etymology is traced to a 1968 letter that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine claiming that Chinese food brought forth ailments.

The letter was uncovered to be a hoax, but the myth remains. The US Food and Drug Administration has long approved MSG for consumption, and studies have failed to show that the chemical causes the alleged "syndrome".

What's the science behind MSG?

The flavour enhancer works when molecules of MSG bind to receptors on the tongue that naturally sense the key flavour chemical it contains - glutamate.

Glutamate is a compound naturally found in foods from breast milk to parmesan cheese.

MSG was patented in 1909 by the Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda, who gave his invention the name "the essence of taste" and described its ineffable flavour as "umami", now recognised as one of the five basic flavours.

Although anecdotal claims that MSG has adverse effects have proliferated since the mid-20th Century, no studies have established any accepted mechanism for harm.

A 2019 review of scientific literature in the journal Food Science and Food Safety concluded that claims linking MSG to an assortment of ailments were unsubstantiated.

Words and meanings

The comedian and chef Eddie Huang and the TV host Jeannie Mai were recruited to bolster the MSG's cause.

"You know what gives me a headache? Racism," says Ms Mai.

The campaign theme fits within a larger movement to elevate ethnic foods, which chefs like Mr Huang have argued are unfairly seen as inferior to European fair.

Merriam-Webster's has said that it will consider revising "Chinese restaurant syndrome". Words recently removed from the reference include hodad, referring to a faux surfer, and Sternforemost, meaning a ship moving backwards in water.</text><tags>Racism, United States, Food</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51106356<category>technology</category><title>Windows 10: NSA reveals major flaw in Microsoft's code</title><text>Image copyright Reuters

The US National Security Agency (NSA) has discovered a major flaw in Windows 10 that could have been used by hackers to create malicious software that looked legitimate.

Microsoft has issued a patch and said it had seen no evidence of the bug being exploited by hackers.

The issue was revealed during an NSA press conference.

It was not clear how long it had known about it before revealing it to Microsoft.

Brian Krebs, the security expert who first reported the revelation, said the software giant had sent the patch to branches of the US military and other high-level users ahead of its wider release. It was, he wrote, "extraordinarily scary".

The problem exists in a core component of Windows known as crypt32.dll, a program that allows software developers to access various functions, such as digital certificates which are used to sign software.

It could, in theory, have allowed a hacker to pass off a piece of malicious software as being entirely legitimate.

The NSA's director of cyber-security Anne Neuberger told reporters that the bug "makes trust vulnerable".

She added that the agency had decided to make its involvement in the discovery public at Microsoft's request.

The flaw is also an issue in Windows Server 2016 and 2019, but does not appear to affect older versions of the operating system.

Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert based at Surrey University, said of the flaw: "It's big because it affects the core cryptographic software used by Microsoft operating systems. Although there is no evidence that it has been exploited by hackers, it is a major threat as it lays users open to a range of attacks, so this is a case of don't panic but apply the patch straightaway."

"The concern is that as soon as the vulnerability is known about in detail, exploits will be produced and the laggards who don't patch will be prime targets."</text><tags>Cyber-security, Microsoft, National Security Agency</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51101049<category>world</category><title>Australia fires: Smoke to make 'full circuit' around globe, Nasa says</title><text>Image copyright NASA Image caption Bushfire smoke as seen near the International Space Station

Smoke from the massive bushfires in Australia will soon circle the Earth back to the nation, says Nasa.

Massive infernos have raged along the nation's east coast for months, pushing smoke across the Pacific.

Nasa said plumes from blazes around New Year's Day had crossed South America, turning skies there hazy, and moved "halfway around Earth" by 8 January.

"The smoke is expected to make at least one full circuit around the globe," the US space agency said.

Hundreds of bushfires have burnt across Australia, killing at least 28 people and destroying more than 2,000 homes.

The unprecedented scale and intensity of the fires has been exacerbated by climate change, experts say.

How has the smoke travelled around the world?

Nasa said recent blazes had been so big they had produced an "unusually large" number of pyrocumulonimbus events - or fire-generated thunderstorms.

These had sent smoke soaring into the stratosphere, with some recorded as high as 17.7km (11 miles).

"Once in the stratosphere, the smoke can travel thousands of miles from its source, affecting atmospheric conditions globally," Nasa said.

The agency said it was studying the effects of smoke at this altitude and whether it provided "a net atmospheric cooling or warming".

What has been the smoke's impact closer to ground?

Nasa noted the smoke had changed the colour of skies in South America, and dramatically affected New Zealand, where it was "causing severe air quality issues" and "visibly darkening mountaintop snow".

Large Australian cities including Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, and Adelaide have also endured dangerous air quality levels due to smoke from nearby bushfires.

On Tuesday, Melbourne residents were enduring a second consecutive day of "hazardous" air quality, prompting concerns about public health.

More than 100 fires continue to burn in the nation's east, however cooler conditions in recent days and forecast rain have aided firefighting efforts.</text><tags>Australia fires, Australia fires, Australia</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-49422017<category>uk</category><title>Woman bedridden for two years by Lyme disease from tick bite</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'A small bite changed my whole world'

A woman went from living the "best years of her life" to almost two years of illness and seclusion in a bedroom because of a tick bite.

Yen Lau, 32, from Glasgow, got Lyme disease after being bitten on a camping trip on a small island on Loch Lomond.

She was unaware of the risk posed by infected ticks and covered a tell-tale rash on her hand with make-up.

After her health deteriorated, Ms Lau said she was misdiagnosed with having chronic fatigue and a pain disorder.

According to the NHS UK website "a few people who are diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease continue to have symptoms, like tiredness, aches and loss of energy, that can last for years".

It adds: "It's not clear why this happens to some people and not others. This means there's also no agreed treatment."

It was not until a year-and-a-half after she was bitten that a test done by a laboratory in Germany confirmed she had Lyme disease.

Ms Lau has now welcomed the development of a new app in the Highlands mapping the occurrence of tick bites and the disease.

Scotland's Rural College (SRUC) is among Scottish organisations working on the technology backed by the European and UK space agencies, and aimed at mapping where the infection has been detected across the Northern Hemisphere.

Lyme disease is an infection that can be spread to humans by ticks carrying the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria.

Diagnosed cases of Lyme disease have reached an estimated 3,000 per year in the UK and more than 65,000 per year in Europe, according to SRUC.

Image caption Ms Lau was bitten on a hand

Ms Lau was 30 and a business manager and make-up artist when she joined friends on the five-day camping trip on Loch Lomond.

She told BBC Scotland: "On my hand I had a little black dot.

"I thought 'aw, get this off me' and snapped the back of it off and left the head briefly in my hand.

"I just ignored it because I didn't realise it was a tick bite, or that it could lead to Lyme disease."

Lyme disease app

A project to develop a new LymeApp has been launched at an event in Inverness.

It is being created to map where ticks bites and Lyme disease have been detected.

The app is being developed in a &#163;1.1m project aimed at providing information on the occurrence of ticks and Lyme disease across the Northern Hemisphere.

It will use satellite data and has received funding from the European and UK space agencies.

The app will draw on information from the Scottish Lyme Disease and Tick-borne Infections Reference Laboratory in Inverness, as well as information from general medical practitioners and those exposed to ticks through work or recreation.

The finished product is to have a function on the app which would allow people to report tick sightings and bites.

Image caption Morven-May MacCallum's says her life has been dominated by Lyme disease for nine years

A new company International Disease Mapping Apps Ltd, which involves SRUC, Highland Health Ventures Ltd, Environmental Research Group Ltd and Belgium-based firm Avia GIS NV, is developing the app.

Morven-May MacCallum, whose life has been dominated by Lyme disease for nine years, was a guest speaker at the launch event.

She said: "Lyme disease is an illness of unquestionable power and the damage it's had on my life and for thousands like me is immeasurable.

"It's wonderful to see professionals from across different areas of expertise come together to help advance our knowledge of this disease and, in the process, hopefully find the answers which are so desperately needed."

A few days later Ms Lau noticed a circular bull's eye-like skin rash on her hand, but covered it with make-up unaware it was an early symptom of Lyme disease.

Flu-like symptoms followed and then severe exhaustion.

Ms Lau said: "I would fall asleep while driving and after I came home from work I would fall asleep at 6pm and wake up 12 hours later fully clothed and make-up still on."

Her health continued to deteriorate to a point where she felt "bone-crushing" fatigue and was slurring her words. A concerned friend took her to Ms Lau's parents home.

Image caption A distinctive bull's eye-like rash is an early symptom of Lyme disease

Ms Lau said that before she fell ill she had been healthy, working a full-time job, going to the gym six times a week and enjoyed socialising with her friends.

"I was a 30-year-old girl living her best life and then all of a sudden six weeks later I had no energy," she said.

"I couldn't get out of my bed, I couldn't brush my teeth on my own.

"I've lost my job and my friends and living in seclusion in a bedroom in my parents' home."

Doctors first diagnosed chronic fatigue disorder before Ms Lau was later told she may have a chronic pain disorder called fibromyalgia, whose sufferers include singer and actress Lady Gaga.

However, after watching a documentary about Lady Gaga's battle with fibromyalgia Ms Lau said she knew something else was afflicting her.

She said: "It took me two weeks to watch the documentary. I could only watch it for 10 minutes at a time before zapping out."

Ms Lau had been tested for Lyme disease and it had ruled it out. However, she said the test was not done for the bacteria spread by infected ticks.

She said the bacteria was only indentified in the test done by the German lab.

Ms Lau, who had the misfortune of later being bitten by a tick a second time while at a retreat in Crete during her recovery from the first bite, has welcomed the raising of awareness of tick bites and Lyme disease through the new app.

The infection can be treated with antibiotics within the first four weeks, and Ms Lau today spends every waking hour researching what treatments could help her now.

"It kills me every day to read on NHS websites that once bitten by a tick you can be given antibiotics within the first four weeks and that's it cured."

Lyme Disease

Image caption Ticks

Ticks that may cause Lyme disease are found all over the UK

High-risk areas include grassy and wooded areas in southern England and the Scottish Highlands

To reduce the risk of being bitten, cover your skin, tuck your trousers into your socks, use insect repellent and stick to paths

If you are bitten, remove the tick with fine-tipped tweezers or a tick-removal tool found in chemists

Clean the bite with antiseptic or soap and water

The risk of getting ill is low as only a small number of ticks are infected with the bacteria that cause Lyme disease

You don't need to do anything else unless you become unwell

You should go to your GP if you've been bitten by a tick or visited an area in the past month where infected ticks are found and you get flu-like symptoms or a circular red rash

These symptoms can include feeling hot and shivery, headaches, aching muscles or feeling sick

Twitter has said it will test new features that allow users to control who can reply to their posts - or block replies entirely.

"We want to help people feel safe participating in the conversation on Twitter," the company said.

The move comes as social media companies are under increasing pressure to address so-called "cyber-bullying".

The firm has already launched a feature which allows its users to hide replies to their tweets.

Twitter unveiled details of the experiment during a presentation at the annual Consumer Electronics Show, in Las Vegas.

The new features, to be tested early this year, will allow users to select four different settings for replies:

Global - allow anyone to respond

Group - allow replies from people the user follows, or mentioned

Panel - allow replies from people mentioned

Statement - not allow any replies

Social media companies are facing intense scrutiny over how they are dealing with harassment - which has led to firms and governments introducing measures to tackle the issue.

YouTube said in December last year that it will no longer allow videos that "maliciously insult someone" based on "protected attributes" such as race, gender identity or sexuality.

In April, the UK government proposed an independent watchdog that will write a "code of practice" for tech companies.

In 2018, Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey promised to increase the "health" of public conversation.

Late last year, the firm launched a feature which allows users to hide certain replies to their tweets, as part of its efforts to tackle abusive behaviour.</text><tags>Social media regulation debate, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Social media, Social media regulation debate</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51140977<category>business</category><title>Flybe boss says government loan is not a bailout</title><text>The boss of Flybe has confirmed the airline is in talks with the government over a loan, but says the financial support would not constitute a bailout.

Mark Anderson told Flybe staff the firm had had a few "difficult days" this week but it still had "a great future".

He said the company's turnaround plan had started to work and that with more time it would be making a big profit.

Rival airlines have called for more details of the government's role in helping Flybe to be made public.

They argue that support for the troubled regional carrier may contravene competition rules.

Mr Anderson, whose address to staff was also carried over videolink and has been seen by the BBC, said the government recognised the airline's vital role in connecting far flung parts of the UK and wanted to help the firm thrive.

"We are in conversation with the government around a financial loan - a loan, not a bailout - a commercial loan, but that is the same as any loan we'd take from any bank," he said.

According to state aid rules the loan would need to either be short term and aimed at rescuing and restructuring the business or it would have to be provided on the same terms a private lender such as a bank would offer.

"The government will not lend if they do not believe there is a credible plan. No-one is going to throw good money after bad," Mr Anderson said.

'More money needed'

Mr Anderson said he wanted to address speculation over the firm's future.

He said the company had had "legacy issues" to deal with that had not been apparent to the group of investors led by Virgin Atlantic who bought the airline early last year.

Image copyright Flybe Image caption Mark Anderson addressed Flybe staff to explain events of the last few days

"Our shareholders invested an awful lot of money, believing they fully understood the state of the business they'd bought," he said.

"The reality&#8230; is that we were in worse shape than even the shareholders thought we were.

"We went into the summer very unresilient in terms of our operation, with a weak fleet, with a lot of gaps in terms of people flying our aircraft, with huge payments being made to people to get them to work extra hours."

A combination of higher costs, late flights, and compensation for delayed passengers meant the firm was losing money "hand over fist" for a time, he said.

"Three-quarters of the money the shareholders invested was gone before we even really started. That has hurt this business and more money is needed."

However, he said by the beginning of January Flybe's turnaround plan was working, with sales ahead of expectations.

"We are in a vastly different place than where we were six months ago," he said.

"We are not making millions of profit at the moment but if we stick to the plan, and what we have to do, we will," he said.

He admitted this week's news coverage had dented sales but said he believed customers would return quickly. But he said that there was a risk of a "self-fulfilling prophesy" if people kept talking the company down.

Fair competition

On Thursday, the boss of rival carrier Ryanair described the government's intervention to support Flybe as a "badly thought-out bailout of a chronically loss-making airline".

Michael O'Leary, sent a strongly worded letter to Chancellor Sajid Javid in which he argued any measures that were being put in place to help Flybe should be extended to other airlines.

"We must be treated the same as Flybe if fair competition is to exist," he wrote.

He said if that were not the case Ryanair would consider taking legal action. British Airways' owner IAG has already filed a complaint with the EU, arguing the rescue may breach state aid rules and has filed a Freedom of Information request for more details about the plan.

The government has not published the details of what it has discussed with Flybe, although it has said it is fully compliant with state aid rules.

The government's support is thought to centre on giving the airline extra time to pay about &#163;100m of outstanding Air Passenger Duty (APD).

Flybe's owners Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital have agreed to invest &#163;30m into the airline.

Stobart Group said it would provide &#163;9m of capital "with the funds drawn down only if required".</text><tags>Air travel, Companies, Flybe</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51097159<category>world</category><title>The Kazakh Muslims detained in China's camps</title><text>Video

Since 2017, thousands of Kazakh Muslims have been detained in China&#8217;s infamous re-education camps. Survivors who have returned to Kazakhstan, say during months of incarceration they were tortured, beaten and received unknown injections.

Ethnic Kazakhs, as well as Uighurs and other Muslim minorities, have lived and moved freely across the Chinese-Kazakh border for centuries. However, as China&#8217;s clampdown on Islam continues, Beijing is now accused of locking up its Kazakh neighbours.

The number of people cautioned or convicted for carrying knives in England and Wales has reached record levels, Ministry of Justice data shows.

There were 14,135 offences in the year to September 2019 - the most since the data was first compiled in 2007.

When possession offences involving other weapons were added, the total was almost 22,300 - the most since 2009.

This week it was reported Boris Johnson will lead a new cabinet committee looking at ways to tackle the crime.

It comes after data released by the Office for National Statistics in October revealed police-recorded offences involving a knife or sharp instrument hit a record high in the year to June - up 7% on the previous 12 months to 44,076.

The latest MoJ figures show that for most offenders (71%) this was their first crime of this kind.

According to the report, offenders are now more likely to be handed an immediate jail sentence for knife and weapon offences, and for longer.

In the year to September, 38% of knife and offensive weapon offences resulted in an immediate custodial sentence compared with 23% for the same period in 2009.

The average length of prison sentences also rose over the same period, from six to eight months, the document said.

BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the record number of knife possession offences could reflect a greater use of police stop-and-search powers, as well as a rise in the number of people carrying knives.

'Murderers are created'

Jonathan McPhillips, 28, was killed after being stabbed in the chest on a north London high street in 2017.

His mother, Michelle, said he had been trying to protect a teenager he knew who was being attacked by a gang when he was stabbed near Islington Town Hall.

The father-of-two, known as JJ, died in hospital four days later, on 28 February.

Michelle, who now campaigns against knife violence, said tougher sentences - including automatic jail sentences for carrying knives - and more police officers were needed to turn the tide against knife crime.

Young people also need to better understand the wide-reaching consequences of knife attacks, she says.

"They don't understand. It's not just the victim's family that are affected - it's the perpetrator's family, too. They feel guilty that they've given birth to a murderer, but no one gives birth to a murderer - murderers are created in our society."

No one has been convicted over Jonathan's killing.

A case against a man accused of the fatal stabbing was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service in 2018 after it decided there was not a realistic prospect of conviction.

But Michelle said she would continue to fight for justice for her son.

"I'm not going away. I won't fade into the background."

'Complex causes'

Barnardo's chief executive Javed Khan said: "We need to tackle the root causes and understand why those involved carry knives.

"Increasing the number and length of sentences can only be part of the solution, as this may not deter young people who are suffering a poverty of hope.

"The new government urgently needs to work with charities, education, health, youth workers, the criminal justice system and local communities to find long-term solutions, so vulnerable children have a reason to turn away from crime."

On Wednesday, the Times reported that Mr Johnson had ordered all Whitehall departments to take action on tackling crime.

According to the paper, the prime minister told ministers every department should consider itself a criminal justice department as part of a drive to look at the "complex causes of crime", which would involve long-term reforms to improve health, social care, youth services and education.

'Little confidence'

Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said there was "no evidence" in the data the government's approach to tackling knife crime was having a positive effect.

"Rising knife crime undermines all the Tory claims on law and order. Unfortunately, until they tackle the crises they created through cuts to policing, schools, to mental health and drug services, there can be little confidence of any major improvement," the Labour frontbencher added.

Justice minister Chris Philp said the government was recruiting 20,000 more police officers, replacing those lost over the last decade, was extending stop-and-search powers and ensuring the most violent offenders were kept in prison for longer.

"These figures should serve as a stark warning to those carrying knives - you are more likely to be jailed, and for longer, than at any point in the last decade," he added.</text><tags>Knife crime, Knife crime, Islington, Ministry of Justice, Crime</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13349398<category>world</category><title>Ethiopia country profile</title><text>Ethiopia is Africa's oldest independent country and its second largest in terms of population. Apart from a five-year occupation by Mussolini's Italy, it has never been colonised.

It has a unique cultural heritage, being the home of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church - one of the oldest Christian denominations - and a monarchy that ended only in the coup of 1974.

It served as a symbol of African independence throughout the continent's colonial period, and was a founder member of the United Nations and the African base for many international organisations.

Drought and civil conflict left Ethiopia in a state of turmoil under a Marxist dictatorship from the fall of the monarchy until 1991, when the long authoritarian rule of Meles Zenawi brought a degree of stability.

Since 2018, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has launched a campaign of political liberalisation at home and sought to end disputes with Ethiopia's neighbours, in particular Eritrea.

Parliament elected Sahle-Work Zewde as the Ethiopia's first woman president in October 2018.

Ms Sahle-Work, an experienced diplomat, promised to work to make gender equality a reality at her swearing-in to the largely ceremonial post.

She took office a week after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed appointed a cabinet with half the posts taken by women.

Prime minister: Abiy Ahmed

Abiy Ahmed was chosen to lead the ruling Ethiopian People Revolutionary Democratic Front coalition after the unexpected resignation of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn in 2018.

The new leader pledged to try to end longstanding tensions with neighbouring Eritrea, and within months the two countries declared that the state of war between them was over.

Mr Abiy also pledged to bring more transparency to government and reconciliation to a country that had been torn by protests since 2015.

He is Ethiopia's first leader from the Oromo ethnic group, which has been at the centre of anti-government protests since 2016.

The prime minister faced the first major challenge to his political course in a coup attempt in Amhara State in June 2019. The army chief and governor of Amhara State were killed in putting down the coup.

MEDIA

The change of government in 2018 looked set to usher in a new era for the media, which for many years had operated in one of the region's most restrictive environments.

The state controls most broadcasting outlets, including national broadcasters ETV and Radio Ethiopia.

Internet and mobile services have been restricted during periods of social unrest.

US politicians expressed concerns about the accuracy and growing use of facial recognition software, at a hearing on Wednesday.

The technology is being developed by firms including Amazon and Microsoft and increasingly used by law enforcement worldwide.

Some facial recognition technologies misidentify women and people of colour.

Civil liberties and privacy groups have raised concerns about how the data for these programs is being gathered.

"This is some real-life Black Mirror stuff that we're seeing here," said New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a reference to a science-fiction TV show that explores the dark side of technology.

US lawmakers are working on a proposal for a bill to limit the use of facial recognition.

'Pause the technology'

Some tech experts have raised concerned about how growing facial recognition databases- controlled by governments and private companies - are being used.

"I think we need to pause the technology and let the rest of it catch up," said Meredith Whittaker, co-director of New York University's AI Now Institute and a witness at the hearing.

She argued rules needed to be put in place requiring consent for facial recognition software. Currently, in the US it is enough for a person to be able to see the camera to grant consent.

Ms Whittaker said corporate interest should not be allowed to "race ahead" and incorporate this technology into their systems without safeguards.

Companies that have said they are working on developing facial recognition programs include Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook.

Companies collect data to build their facial recognition software in multiple ways including through CCTV footage and by scraping websites including photo-sharing sites like Flickr and Facebook.

Photo filters like the ones used on Instagram and Snapchat can also be used to hone details of faces.

Police forces in the US have pointed to the successful use of facial recognition technology to identify missing children and criminals.

But biases in the algorithms have led to misidentification. Those accused of crimes because of facial recognition software are often not told the technology has been used.

There are also concerns the technology could be used by authoritarian regimes to monitor citizens.

Countries like China already have extensive surveillance systems set up. Facial recognition makes it easier to track a person's movement.

While the technology is not flawless now, some lawmakers wondered about the implications as the technology becomes more accurate.

"If we only focus on the fact that they're not getting it right with facial recognition, we missed the whole argument," said Rep Mark Meadows, from North Carolina.

"Irrespective of its accuracy, there are intrinsic concerns with this technology and its use," Representative Gerry Connolly from Virginia told the panel.

This was the third hearing the US House of Representative Oversight Committee has held on the facial recognition technology in less than a year.</text><tags>Artificial intelligence, United States, Facial recognition</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51120166<category>world</category><title>Russian government resigns as Vladimir Putin plans future</title><text>Image copyright Reuters Image caption President Vladimir Putin announced the proposals in his annual state of the nation address

Russia's government has resigned, hours after President Vladimir Putin proposed sweeping constitutional changes that could prolong his stay in power.

If approved by the public, the proposals would transfer power from the presidency to parliament.

Mr Putin is due to step down in 2024 when his fourth term of office comes to an end.

But there is speculation he could seek a new role or hold on to power behind the scenes.

Mr Putin put forward his plans in his annual state of the nation address to lawmakers. Later, in an unexpected move, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev announced that the government was resigning to help facilitate the changes.

Russian government sources told the BBC that ministers did not know about the government's resignation ahead of the announcement.

"It was a complete surprise," one source said.

What is Mr Putin proposing?

The Russian leader said during a speech to both chambers of parliament that there would be a nationwide vote on changes that would shift power from the presidency to parliament.

Constitutional reforms included giving the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, "greater responsibility" for the appointment of the prime minister and the cabinet.

Currently, the president appoints the prime minister, and the Duma approves the decision.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Putin met Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Wednesday ahead of the decision that the government would resign

Mr Putin also suggested an increased role for an advisory body called the State Council. The council, which is currently chaired by Mr Putin, comprises the heads of Russia's federal regions. Mr Putin said it had proved to be "highly effective".

Other measures include:

Limiting the supremacy of international law

Amending the rules that limit presidents to two consecutive terms

Strengthening laws that prohibit presidential candidates who have held foreign citizenship or foreign residency permits

What was the response?

Mr Medvedev made his announcement on state television with President Putin sitting next to him.

"These changes, when they are adopted... will introduce substantial changes not only to an entire range of articles of the constitution, but also to the entire balance of power, the power of the executive, the power of the legislature, the power of judiciary," Mr Medvedev said of Mr Putin's proposals.

"In this context... the government in its current form has resigned."

Mr Putin thanked Mr Medvedev for his work but said "not everything" had been accomplished.

He asked Mr Medvedev to become deputy head of the National Security Council, which is chaired by Mr Putin.

The president later nominated tax service chief Mikhail Mishustin to replace Mr Medvedev as prime minister.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Head of the tax service, Mikhail Mishustin (L), has been put forward by Mr Putin as the new prime minister

Mr Medvedev has been prime minister for several years. He previously served as president from 2008-2012, switching roles with Mr Putin - a close ally - after the latter served his first two terms as president. Russia's constitution only allows presidents to serve two consecutive terms.

Even when he was prime minister, Mr Putin was widely seen as the power behind then President Medvedev.

Opposition leader and leading Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said he believed that any referendum on the constitutional changes would be "fraudulent crap". He said Mr Putin's goal was to be "sole leader for life".

The last time Russia held a referendum was in 1993 when it adopted the constitution under President Boris Yeltsin, Mr Putin's predecessor.

Mr Putin became acting president following Mr Yeltsin's resignation in 1999 and was formally inaugurated a year later. He has held the reins of power - as president or prime minister - ever since.

Part of Putin's bigger plan?

President Putin likes stability. It's his thing. So the newsflash that the entire government had resigned was a big surprise. From the online chatter, it seems even the cabinet ministers didn't see it coming. For a moment it was like a flashback to Russia of the 1990s, when President Yeltsin changed prime ministers as readily as his socks. Vladimir Putin is no Yeltsin, though, and this move looks like part of some bigger plan that's all about consolidating - and extending - his hold on power.

Under the current rules, Mr Putin must step down as president in 2024 and it's never been clear what he'd do next. That's still true. But the constitutional tweaks he's proposed are hints at some options. He's bumped up the status of the little-known State Council, which he already heads. Or he could become PM again, now he's slightly weakened the powers of Russia's president.

If he is sticking around, perhaps he needs to make that palatable to people given all the social and economic problems he had to list once again in his annual address to the nation. If Mr Putin were to blame for their woes, Russians might well wonder why they should swallow him staying on, post-2024. Dmitry Medvedev - so often useful to Mr Putin - for now looks like a handy scapegoat.

What else did Mr Putin say?

In his address to parliament, the president unveiled a series of plans to increase the number of children being born in Russia. Like several Eastern European states, Russia has been struggling with a declining birth rate.

Last year Mr Putin promised tax breaks for bigger families.

On Wednesday he pledged state funding for new mothers in a bid to increase the number of children being born from an average of fewer than 1.5 per woman to 1.7 within four years.

So-called "maternity capital" has until now only been paid to families with at least two children.

Welfare benefits will also be paid for children aged three to seven in low-income families, and free school meals will be provided for the first four years of school.

A three-year-old girl and her pet dog have been found safe and well 24 hours after they went missing in Western Australia's flood-hit Pilbara region.

The girl was lost on Wednesday after wandering off from her home on Noreena Downs Homestead, around 70km from Nullagine.

She and her Jack Russell became trapped after heavy rain flooded creeks surrounding her home, police said.

A search involving helicopters was launched as concerns for the girl grew.

But on Thursday afternoon, she was spotted from a helicopter around 3.5km (2.1 miles) from her home.

When the authorities picked up the girl, she was caked in mud but otherwise fine. Her dog was by her side, still protecting her, police said.

"Happily, Matilda and her dog have now been returned to her family," Western Australia Police Force said in a statement posted to Facebook.

Kim Massam, Pilbara's police superintendent, praised those involved in the search, and the girl's dog, who "stayed with her that whole time".

Pilbara is one of the western Australian regions that have been impacted by heavy rain in recent days, leading to flooding and road closures.

An ex-tropical cyclone swept along Australia's western coast last week, bringing up to 200-400mm of rain in parts of the region.

What effect has the rain had on bushfires?

Widespread rains across Australia have brought much-needed respite from the catastrophic bushfires that have ravaged large parts of the country for months.

Since September, bushfires have killed at least 28 people and destroyed thousands of homes. The lack of rain has exacerbated the crisis, which has been particularly severe in the southern states of New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria.

Australians have welcomed the rainfall, especially in places where the bushfires have wrought the most devastation.

Firefighters are relieved, too, after the heavens opened on Wednesday and Thursday, giving them hope that blazes could be brought under control.

As of Thursday morning, 85 bush and grass fires were burning across the state, with 30 to be contained, NSW fire service said.

"Although this rain won't extinguish all fires, it will certainly go a long way towards containment," the fire service tweeted.

Storms have also helped disperse smoke in Melbourne, which has endured hazardous air quality in recent days.

Earlier in the week, some players competing at the Australian Open in Melbourne complained about having to play qualifying matches in smoky conditions.

What is the latest forecast?

The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has issued wind warnings for Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania, but stood down severe thunderstorm warnings in the Northern Territory and NWS.

A severe thunderstorm warning for Queensland still stands. On Friday, severe thunderstorms in the state are "likely to produce damaging winds and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding", the forecaster said.

The forecaster said some parts of bushfire and drought-affected eastern Australia could see 50-100mm of rain over the next few days.

It added there was a 50% chance of average rainfall levels between 1 March and 30 May in the country's east.

However, the bureau said more rain was needed to end Australia's drought.</text><tags>Australia, Floods, Western Australia</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50243306<category>world</category><title>Twitter to ban all political advertising</title><text>Image copyright Reuters Image caption Jack Dorsey said details would follow in November

Twitter is to ban all political advertising worldwide, saying that the reach of such messages "should be earned, not bought".

"While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics," company CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted.

Social media rival Facebook recently ruled out a ban on political ads.

News of the ban divided America's political camps for the 2020 election.

Brad Parscale, manager of President Donald Trump's re-election campaign, said the ban was "yet another attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives".

But Bill Russo, spokesman for the campaign to elect Democratic front-runner Joe Biden, said: "When faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy, it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out."

Reacting to the move, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg defended his company's policy.

"In a democracy, I don't think it's right for private companies to censor politicians or the news," he said during a conference call with journalists.

Twitter's ban will be enforced from 22 November, with full details released by 15 November.

How does Dorsey justify the ban?

Mr Dorsey explained his position in a thread of tweets.

Internet political ads, he said, presented "entirely new challenges to civic discourse".

These challenges included "machine learning-based optimisation of messaging", "micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes".

"It's not credible," he wrote, "for us to say: 'We're working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, but if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad&#8230;well...they can say whatever they want!'"

Countering the argument that the new policy might be seen as favouring leaders already in office, he pointed out that "many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising".

Ads in support of voter registration would not be affected by the ban, he added.

How is news of the ban playing out?

Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic candidate who lost to Mr Trump in the 2016 presidential election, welcomed Twitter's ban and appeared to challenge Facebook to rethink its stance.

Social media analyst Carl Miller said it was "one of the first times a tech giant has stepped back in concern for the enormous disruptions they're doing to the institutions that don't move as quickly as them".

Jack Dorsey's decision is more significant for its timing and the principle it upholds than the practical effects it will have on modern democracy.

Political ads on Twitter are just a fraction, in scale and impact, of those on Facebook. Mr Dorsey knew - and his chief financial officer has since confirmed - that this decision would have little impact on the company's bottom line.

They therefore calculated that they could win a thumbs up from regulators and public opinion at little cost to the business.

And they could also mischievously provoke Facebook, who are in a more difficult position on the subject. It cannot be mere coincidence that Mr Dorsey's tweet was just a fortnight after Mark Zuckerberg's speech on the same subject.

A dividing line between the companies is useful for Twitter. It puts the onus on Facebook to once again defend its stance.

It is very easy to find damaging or deceitful ads online. But asking Californian companies to decide what should or shouldn't be in the public domain grants them enormous power that is hard to undo. They already make such decisions on things like violent or hateful content; asking them to go further is, in effect, turning them into editorial arbiters of public conversation.

That is, journalists.

What is Facebook's policy?

Earlier this month, Mr Zuckerberg went before an audience of students in Washington DC to defend the firm's decision not to ban political adverts that contain falsehoods.

He had considered barring all political ads on his platforms, but said he believed the move would favour incumbent politicians and whoever the media chose to cover.

The company should "err on the side of greater expression", he argued.

Image copyright Facebook Image caption Zuckerberg gave his speech to an audience of students and others at Georgetown University in Washington DC

Another spokesman for Mr Biden had criticised the firm for refusing to remove a video posted by Mr Trump's 2020 re-election campaign which promoted an unproven conspiracy theory involving the former vice-president and his son.

"It is unacceptable for any social media company to knowingly allow deliberately misleading material to corrupt its platform," TJ Ducklo said.

Fellow Democratic candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren then paid to run an intentionally misleading advert on Facebook that claimed Mr Zuckerberg had personally endorsed Donald Trump for re-election.

She said she had done so to protest against the firm's decision to allow politicians to run ads containing "known lies".

How much impact will this have on the US election?

US federal campaigns are expected to spend about $6bn (&#163;4.6bn) on advertising but most of it will go on TV ads, with about 20% put into digital ads, advertising research firm Kantar estimates.

Twitter is also much smaller than Facebook. In February, it said it had 126m daily active users while Facebook boasted 1.63bn in September.

Meanwhile the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said political strategists often counted on their message being spread for free.</text><tags>Social media regulation debate, Twitter, Fake News, Social media regulation debate</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48222017<category>technology</category><title>Use of facial recognition tech 'dangerously irresponsible'</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Police facial recognition systems have been shown to do poorly when analysing non-white faces

Black and minority ethnic people could be falsely identified and face questioning because police have failed to test how well their systems deal with non-white faces, say campaigners.

At least three chances to assess how well the systems deal with ethnicity were missed over the past five years, the BBC found.

Campaigners said the tech had too many problems to be used widely.

"It must be dropped immediately," said privacy rights group Big Brother Watch.

Lost lesson

Several UK police forces have been trialling controversial new facial recognition technology, including automated systems which attempt to identify the faces of people in real time as they pass a camera.

Documents from the police, Home Office and university researchers show that police are aware that ethnicity can have an impact on such systems, but have failed on several occasions to test this.

The Home Office said facial recognition can be an "invaluable tool" in fighting crime.

"The technology continues to evolve, and the Home Office continues to keep its effectiveness under constant review," a spokesman told the BBC.

The ability of facial recognition software to cope with black and ethnic minority faces has proved a key concern for those worried about the technology, who claim the software is often trained on predominantly white faces.

Minutes from a police working group reveal that the UK police's former head of facial recognition knew that skin colour was an issue. At an April 2014 meeting, Durham Police Chief Constable Mike Barton noted "that ethnicity can have an impact on search accuracy".

He asked CGI, the Canadian company managing the police's facial image database, to investigate the issue, but subsequent minutes from the working group do not mention a follow-up.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Met police boss Cressida Dick said she use of facial recognition was "lawful and appropriate"

Facial recognition was introduced on the Police National Database (PND), which includes around 13 million faces, in 2014.

The database has troubled privacy groups because it contains images of people subsequently cleared of any offence. A 2012 court decision ruled that holding such images was unlawful.

The "unlawful" images are still held on the PND. The government is currently investigating ways to purge them from the system.

Despite this, the PND facial recognition system, provided by German company Cognitec, has proved very popular.

The number of face match searches done on the PND grew from 3,360 in 2014 to 12,504 in 2017, Freedom of Information requests to the Home Office have revealed.

In 2015, a team of assessors from the Home Office tested the PND facial search system, using about 200 sample images. They had identified ethnicity information about the sample photos but, once again, failed to use this opportunity to check how well the system worked with different skin colours.

The same Home Office report also estimated that, across the entire PND, about 40% of the images were duplicated.

It noted that this meant the UK government has overpaid hundreds of thousands of pounds to Cognitec, because the company charges more once the number of images (or "templates") on the database exceeds 10 million.

The Home Office assessment also found the facial recognition system was only half as good as the human eye. It said: "Out of the initial 211 searches, the automated facial search of PND identified just 20 true matches, whereas visual examination by the tester identified a total of 56 matches."

Cognitec declined to comment on costs, but said its matching technology had improved since the Home Office report, and that facial recognition results always required review by a human.

A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs Council said the technology had the potential to disrupt criminals, but said any roll-out must show its effectiveness within "sufficient safeguards". It added that work is being done to improve the system's accuracy and remove duplicates.

Another chance to check for racial bias was missed last year during trials by South Wales of real-time facial recognition software, which was used at sports events and concerts. Cardiff University carried out an assessment of the force's use of the technology,

That study stated that "due to limited funds for this trial", ethnicity was not tested.

Cardiff's report noted, however, that "during the evaluation period, no overt racial discrimination effects were observed", but said this may be due to the demographic make-up of the watch lists used by the force.

In addition, an interim report by a biometrics advisory group to the government considering ethical issues of facial recognition highlighted concerns about the lack of ethnic diversity in datasets.

Under-representation of certain types of faces, particularly those from ethnic minorities, could mean bias "feeds forward" into the use of the technology, it said.

Silkie Carlo, director of campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: "The police's failure to do basic accuracy testing for race speaks volumes.

"Their wilful blindness to the risk of racism, and the risk to Brits' rights as a whole, reflects the dangerously irresponsible way in which facial recognition has crept on to our streets."

The technology had too many problems to justify its used, she said.

"It must be dropped immediately," Ms Carlo added.

A four-year-old girl died after her bike helmet got caught on a branch, an inquest has heard.

Freya Thorpe "potentially slipped" as she climbed a tree after setting her bike aside while playing with a friend in Upper Heyford, Bicester.

The court heard she was suspended from the branch and the helmet strap became "tight against her throat".

Coroner Darren Salter ruled her death, on 8 September last year, was an accident.

Her father Christopher Thorpe told Oxford Coroner's Court the family's lives had been "utterly destroyed" by his daughter's death.

He said he and his wife loved her "more than life itself".

The court heard Freya had been playing with another girl of similar age near their homes when the accident happened.

Elisabeth McCall, who was passing by with a child, found Freya and dialled 999 but was unable to remove her from the tree, the court heard.

Paramedic Peter Elsmore said a man was performing CPR on her when he arrived.

The four-year-old died at the John Radcliffe Hospital two days later due to the brain injuries she sustained.

The court heard the area where the accident happened was a "popular place for younger children to play" and was surrounded by 12 houses.

Mr Thorpe said: "I would like to thank anybody that tried to help my little girl."</text><tags>Oxford, Bicester</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/51142447<category>sport</category><title>Ashley Young: Manchester United agree fee with Inter Milan</title><text>Ashley Young scored 19 times for Manchester United, with his last goal coming in the 4-0 win over AZ Alkmaar in the Europa League in December

Manchester United have agreed a &#163;1.28m (1.5m euros) fee with Inter Milan for defender Ashley Young.

The 34-year-old had previously told United of his desire to join Inter and has not been involved in the club's past three games.

It is understood the deal includes an add-on fee, which will be activated if Inter win Serie A this season.

If the January transfer is finalised, it will bring an end to Young's eight-and-a-half-year stay at Old Trafford.

The deal is subject to a medical, scheduled to take place in Milan on Friday, and the agreement of personal terms.

He has played 261 times for United and was club captain this season, although he only started 10 league games in 2019-20.

Young, who has played 39 times for England, joined United from Aston Villa in 2011 and has been part of squads that won the Premier League in 2012-13, the FA Cup in 2015-16, and both the League Cup and Europa League in 2016-17.

Inter, who signed Romelu Lukaku from United last August and also have Alexis Sanchez on loan from the Red Devils, are second in Serie A, two points adrift of Juventus.

Under former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte, they are aiming to win their first Serie A title since 2010.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51099102<category>uk</category><title>Queen agrees 'transition' to new role for Harry and Meghan</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond breaks down the Queen's statement

The Queen has agreed a "period of transition" in which the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will spend time in Canada and the UK.

She said she was "entirely supportive" of their desire for a new role but "would have preferred" them to remain full-time working royals.

She expected final decisions to be made in the coming days, she said.

Senior royals have been in talks about Prince Harry and Meghan's role after they said they wanted to "step back".

In a statement, the Queen said the talks at Sandringham, which also involved the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, had been "very constructive".

"My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan's desire to create a new life as a young family," she said.

"Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family."

She said it had been agreed there would be "a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK" after Harry and Meghan "made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives".

"These are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, but I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days," she said.

The urgent talks were convened after the Sussexes surprised the rest of the Royal Family on Wednesday with a statement expressing their desire to "step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family".

They also said they wanted a "progressive new role" within the institution, where they would be financially independent and divide their time between the UK and North America.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Global News there had been "no discussions" about the details of the couple's move, including on the issues of security and any potential impact on Canada's taxpayers.

Although no other family member was consulted about the timing of the announcement, the duke and duchess said it came after "many months of reflection and internal discussions".

Both Prince Harry and Meghan spoke of the difficulties of royal life and media attention in recent months, with the duke saying he feared his wife would fall victim to "the same powerful forces" that led to his mother's death.

The talks about their future took place as Prince Harry and Prince William issued a joint statement denying "false claims" that their relationship had been damaged by "bullying" on the part of the older brother.

They said that the "inflammatory language" in the claims was "offensive" and "potentially harmful", given their support for mental health causes.

'The Queen's regret is obvious'

This is a remarkably candid and informal, almost personal, statement from the Queen.

Her regret over Harry and Meghan's move is obvious - she would have preferred them to stay in their current roles.

But she also makes clear that they are still royals and that they will be valued in the family as they become a more independent couple.

There are buckets of questions outstanding - on their future royal role, their relationship with the rest of the Palace, on who will pay what (not, the Queen says, the taxpayer), and on how Harry and Meghan will support themselves.

There's still a lot to thrash out and to agree on. Not all of it may become public.

And it looks like the Queen sees this as a process, not an event. She writes of a transition period when Harry and Meghan divide their time between Canada and the UK.

The Queen has asked for decisions to be made over the next few days. But those decisions may well be up for review in the coming months and years.

Historian Robert Lacey told the BBC Radio 4's PM programme the Queen's statement following the meeting was unusually personal, with several references to "my family" and "my grandson".

"It is remarkably hands-on. I mean it may have been processed through officials but this is the Queen, speaking to her people and speaking about her family, and I think coming right through it is the concern she feels," he said.

Instead of using the formal titles of the couple - the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - the Queen simply called them "Harry and Meghan".

Penny Junor, an author of books about the royals, said that the statement "read to me like a grandmother talking about the family", adding that it would "take the pressure off" the duke and duchess.

"I think they're in a very vulnerable state at the moment. I think they're unhappy, they feel isolated and unloved, unappreciated and they needed careful handling," she said.

"My reading from that statement is that the family has been sensitive to their vulnerability."

How did we get here?

In their statement on Wednesday, posted on the couple's official Instagram account, the duke and duchess said they intend to "step back" as senior royals, spending time in North America, while "continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages".

It came after an interview last October, when Prince Harry and Meghan publicly revealed their struggles under the media spotlight.

The duke also issued an impassioned statement attacking what he described as "relentless propaganda" in parts of the media, as lawyers for his wife began legal action against the Mail on Sunday.

The couple were already preparing to launch their own Sussex Royal charity, which they set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's foundation in June last year.

It was revealed in December that the couple had made an application to trademark their Sussex Royal brand for items including books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social care services.</text><tags>Justin Trudeau, UK Royal Family, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40914748<category>world</category><title>A reckoning in Charlottesville</title><text>Image copyright Joel Gunter Image caption Nationalists descended on Charlottesville to defend a Confederate statue

In the middle of Emancipation Park in Charlottesville on Saturday, two young women, one white and one black, took each other's hands and held them tightly, and with their other hands they gripped the steel barrier in front of them.

A few feet away, a young white man with a buzzed haircut and sunglasses leaned towards them over a facing barrier. "You'll be on the first f*****g boat home," he screamed at the black woman, before turning to the white woman. "And as for you," he said coolly, "you're going straight to hell." Then he gave a Nazi salute.

For the third time in a few months, white nationalists had descended on the small, liberal city of Charlottesville in the southern state of Virginia, to protest against the planned removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee.

This time they came under the banner of the so-called "alt-right", for a rally they called "Unite the Right". They were a motley crew of militia, racists, and neo-Nazis, and some who said they simply wanted to defend their Southern history.

They gathered early in the morning at Emancipation Park - formerly Lee Park - where the statue sits. Some were dressed in full tactical gear and openly carrying rifles. Others wore black shirts, helmets, and boots.

In a column they surged into the park, using sticks and their fists to shove aside anti-fascist counter-protesters. Then they blocked off the entrance with shields. Inside, David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, grinned and waved as the crowd, almost entirely white and male, cheered him on, chanting his name and putting their arms up in Nazi salutes.

They had reason to be pleased. They were in the middle of the largest gathering of white nationalists in America for decades.

In the park, in a pen ringed by steel barriers, the nationalists shouted anti-immigrant, anti-semitic and racist slogans and targeted white women counter-protesters, calling them "traitors" who "needed to get subjugated". Outside, anti-fascist protesters threw bottles, rocks and paint and chanted "Off our streets, Nazi scum". Pepper spray, used by both sides, filled the air.

Eventually, riot police moved into the park and the streets around it, pushing everyone back. The governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency and the rally was cancelled. The national guard began to close off the area, but not before a driver ploughed into a crowd of counter-protesters two blocks away, killing a young woman and injuring 19 others.

'One long prayer'

Twenty-four hours earlier, Reverend Brenda Brown-Grooms closed her eyes and prayed for peace. Sitting in a side room at St Paul's Memorial Church, while volunteers undertook non-violent resistance training next door, she prepared herself for a "reckoning" the following day in her home town.

"This is physically a very beautiful place, it has always been my template for what a city should look like," she said. "But I've always understood that this beautiful place is also quite ugly. And the statue has become the match point for that ugliness."

Reverend Brown-Grooms was born in Charlottesville in 1955. She grew up in Vinegar Hill, a black neighbourhood since razed to the ground in one of a series of redevelopment programmes that pushed the black community out of the city and into housing projects.

As a girl, under segregation, she did not dare set foot in the white neighbourhood which was home to Emancipation Park - then Lee Park - and she had never been there until May, when the KKK came to town and lit torches under the statue.

"This summer has been one long prayer here in Charlottesville," she said. "And now today we are praying again, we are praying that the alt-right don't start something tonight, ahead of the rally."

Within a few hours, her prayer went unanswered. About 200 white nationalists gathered after dark in Nameless Field, down the road from where she sat, and marched through the University of Virginia campus holding torches. They chanted "Blood and soil" - an old Nazi slogan - and "Jews will not replace us".

At the base of the university's statue of Thomas Jefferson, on the Main Street side of the campus, they were met by university students who came to resist them, linking arms and surrounding the statue. The air was hot from the torches and acrid from smoke.

"The heat here is nothing compared to what you're going to get in the ovens," shouted Robert Ray, a writer for the white supremacist website Daily Stormer. "It's coming," he spat.

"White supremacists walking through my university with torches, I never thought I'd have to see this in America in my lifetime," said one of the counter-protesters, a student who did not want to be named.

Image copyright Joel Gunter Image caption Hundreds of white nationalists gathered at the UVA statue of Thomas Jefferson on Friday night

Directly across the street, at the same time, more than 500 people were packed into St. Paul's church for a multi-faith service. There were readings from the Bible and the Koran, spirituals sung by a choir, and a speech by activist and Harvard professor Dr Cornel West that drew everyone in the house to their feet.

"It is bleak that we are about to see the largest neo-fascist gathering in decades, but it is also a joy to be able to struggle against it, to bear witness to it," said Dr West after the service.

"The alt-right is a new danger. We have a right-wing gangster in the White House who emboldens them, who empowers them. So they feel they have permission for their hate to come out in public, and maybe even harm others. We are in a dangerous moment."

As the service drew to a close, and the last spirituals were sung, the congregation filed slowly out of a side door to avoid the white nationalists who were walking back up Main Street.

'Racial realism'

The speakers booked for the rally in Charlottesville were all men. The people who came to attend the rally were almost all men, and across the country the following of the so-called "alt-right" is overwhelmingly male.

One of the few women who speaks regularly at white nationalist events is Avialae Horton, a 20-year-old from Georgia who is editor of the Revolutionary Conservative, an online, right-wing newspaper with a mission to "defend Western civilisation".

The members of the "new-right" are being unfairly branded as "Nazis and fascists", she said in Charlottesville ahead of the rally. "We stand in confidence in our convictions, irrespective of what others think of that. And I absolutely believe that we have been misrepresented."

Three women from the Revolutionary Conservative flew into Charlottesville for the rally. They preach what they call "racial realism", which they say is not racism.

"It's natural for people to want to be with their own kind, and to look to their own interests," said RS McCoy, another member of staff from the paper, who came from California.

"We're going to care about our interests first, black people are going to care about their interests first, and even moving outside of race into things like LGBT, they're going to care about their interests first. And that is not bad, it doesn't have to be demonised."

The removal of the Robert E Lee statue in Charlottesville, and the removal of other Confederate statues in the South, threatened to strip away American history, Ms McCoy said.

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, more than 60 Confederate monuments or symbols have been removed or renamed since the 2015 massacre of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, by white supremacist Dylann Roof.

Tearing down the statues was depriving black Americans of the chance to learn their own history, said Ms McCoy.

"If we look at it from their perspective even, which is you know - Oh we've had slavery and racism and all these horrible things and we want to make this go away, so we're going to tear down monuments and rename all these streets - how are future generations going to learn?"

Standing in the middle of Emancipation Park on Friday, looking up at the statue of Robert E Lee, the city's deputy mayor Wes Bellamy took a different view.

Mr Bellamy is the first black deputy mayor of the city. A sharply-dressed, outgoing character, emphatic in his desire to see the statue removed - "155%" - he has become a lightning rod for people who believe their heritage is being torn up.

"I get hate mail and death threats every day. I've been told I will be hung from this statue. I've been told I will be hung from the trees in this park," he said.

"But that lets you know what you're doing is right. How can you have a 28ft statue to a man who, if he were alive today, I would not be allowed to look in the eye? Who, if he were walking down the street, would make me walk off the sidewalk? How can we have that statue here, if we are to be an equitable city?"

Mr Bellamy stopped in the park to speak to residents, who congratulated him on passing his doctorate that day, and to local police officers, some of whom he knew by name. Then he headed off, under strict instructions from police, as the white nationalists came into town, to keep his whereabouts on Saturday a secret.

Joy Town, USA

As the National Guard closed down the streets around Emancipation Park on Saturday evening, the protesters dissipated into smaller skirmishes nearby. Daryl Vaughan, 24, who came from Newcastle, Virginia to join the white nationalists, got caught alone, surrounded by anti-fascist protesters who beat him, kicking him in the face and chest as he lay on the ground.

Bloodied, he retreated to a side street. "They've come here to take my history away, to make my history look bad," he said. "Black lives matter, that's bullshit to me."

A few hundred white nationalists moved north and gathered in McIntyre Park, but with little attention on them in the large, open park, they began to disperse, some marching in a column along the highway to their cars, while passing drivers honked in support or hurled abuse.

Slowly the chaos and violence of earlier gave way to reflection and to tragedy. A 32-year-old woman had been killed, run over by a man who ploughed into peaceful counter-protesters on the street near Emancipation Park, and who was later arrested and charged with murder.

In a separate incident, two state police employees died when their helicopter, which had hovered over downtown Charlottesville for most of the day observing the rally, crashed.

"Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia. So sad!," the president tweeted.

It was left to Terry McAuliffe, the governor of Virginia, to condemn the white nationalists that poured into the city from around the country. "Go home," he said at a press conference. "There is no place for you here."

Three years ago, the US National Bureau of Economic Research named Charlottesville America's happiest city. "Joy Town, USA", the media called it.

But spirits were low around Joy Town on Saturday. "I wonder if Charlottesville will ever be the same after this," said Henry McHenry, 63, as he watched the National Guard march past his home of 30 years. "We must get past this state of us against them," he said.

Late on Saturday night, after a long day that began with a dawn prayer service at 6am, Reverend Brown-Grooms tried to make some sense of what she had seen on the streets of her city that day.

"I come from a people who were enslaved, and to make it through that misery there has to be a spirit which allows you to see past what your eyes see in front of you and what your ears hear, and to understand how hope forms in your heart," she said.

"As our people used to say, trouble don't last always. It might last all of my lifetime, but not always."</text><tags>Alt-right, United States, Virginia</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/51133976<category>sport</category><title>South Africa v England: Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope give tourists edge</title><text>Ollie Pope struck seven fours in his unbeaten 39

Third Test, Port Elizabeth, (day one of five): England 224-4: Crawley 44, Rabada 2-48 South Africa: Yet to bat Scorecard

An unbroken stand of 76 between Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope gave England a slight edge over South Africa at the end of a fluctuating first day of the third Test in Port Elizabeth.

On a lifeless pitch, the tourists were in danger of being overwhelmed when they lost three wickets for 35 runs to slip to 148-4.

But Stokes solidly moved to 38 not out and Pope shone in his unbeaten 39 to take England to 224-4 at the close.

They will return on Friday looking to buck a trend which has seen the rest of the top order fail to capitalise on good starts.

When Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley were adding 70 for the first wicket, it appeared as though England were going to take full advantage of winning the toss.

However, South Africa wrestled their way into the contest thanks mainly to superb spinner Keshav Maharaj and the tactics of captain Faf du Plessis.

Only late in the day, as the second new ball was repelled for 10 overs, did England take the advantage, especially with the hosts set to bat last on a surface that is likely to deteriorate.

Still, wickets early on day two would shift the momentum again, meaning the series - level at 1-1 - remains in the balance.

Fluctuating fortunes

This was a slow-burning day, one which gave no clue to its eventual fluctuations in a tepid morning session.

Under a cloudless sky and on a straw-coloured pitch, Sibley and Crawley batted to lunch with few alarms and there was more energy in the band that played in the stand than there was in the contest.

That changed when left-arm spinner Maharaj took a grip of one end, stifling the tourists and allowing the pace bowlers to nag away from the other.

If the battle in the afternoon session was gripping, England doing their best to repel the South African effort, the hosts threatened to take control after tea when Joe Denly and Joe Root were dismissed in quick succession.

At that stage, it could have can been argued England were not showing enough intent to score, although that would have ignored the quality of the South Africa bowling and the impact of the pitch.

Ultimately, the tourists have a platform for a large total, one that could heavily pressurise a South Africa side, especially with the pitch already offering turn.

Stokes and Pope steady England

Even if there were times when England were too ponderous in their approach with the bat, that is at least a change to the policy under former coach Trevor Bayliss, when extreme aggression in similar situations often led to batting capitulations.

Sibley looked to be carrying on from his second-Test century for his 36, while Crawley was less convincing - especially against the short ball - in making 44.

Of the top four, Denly found it hardest to score, completely smothered by Maharaj before he was lbw to the same bowler for 25, and Root tried to force the issue in his 27.

All, though, were overshadowed by Pope, the 22-year-old who is increasingly looking at home in Test cricket. He scored with handsome drives on both sides of the wicket and hit three successive fours in Anrich Nortje's first over with the new ball.

At the other end, Stokes, England's match-winner in the second Test and the newly crowned International Cricket Council player of the year, settled in.

As a sign of the regard he is held in by South Africa, three times they called for reviews against him, with two so speculative they were lost.

South Africa hang in

In the morning session, South Africa's tactics were curious and their bowling lacklustre. The Proteas opted for debutant Dane Paterson to take the new ball ahead of Kagiso Rabada, both men part of a pace unit that collectively bowled too short.

The improvement in the afternoon session was stark, the wily Maharaj conceding less than two runs an over in an unchanged spell of 30 overs and the fast bowlers executing Du Plessis' plan.

Targeting the stumps with as many as six fielders on the leg side, South Africa persuaded Sibley to turn Rabada to leg gully, where Rassie van der Dussen took a superb diving catch.

Crawley fell into the same trap, clipping Nortje to Dean Elgar behind square on the leg side.

Maharaj finally had his reward when wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock persuaded Du Plessis to call for an lbw review against Denly, while Rabada scuttled one into the top of Root's off stump.

Only late in the day did the home threat drop, unsurprising given the sapping heat and the effort required for the bowlers to get something out of the pitch.

'It has been a really good day for England'

Former England assistant coach Paul Farbrace on The Cricket Social: "It has been a really good day for England. The first two batsmen played very nicely and they gave England a good chance.

"It got tough for a period; it was really hard to score and to trust the bounce of the ball. Pope was allowed to play well by how well they played earlier."

England batsman Zak Crawley told the Test Match Special podcast: "We're happy with that. The pitch is only going to get worse from here. If we can bat well tomorrow and put ourselves in a good position, a first-innings lead would be very nice. The pitch was slow, so it was tough to score. There wasn't a lot in it for batters or bowlers."

BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: "It has been a rollercoaster of a day, in a quiet sort of way. It looked like a nailed-on five-day game, but on came Maharaj and it was kicking up.

"You assume that bounce is going to get worse as the game goes on. If England can get 350 from here, that's a pretty good position."

Former England spinner Phil Tufnell: "England will have learnt a lot with the bowling. It's going to be one of those pitches when you bowl straight, with split fields, and if you do that it's very difficult to score runs on. A 350 total becomes more like 450."</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51143639<category>world</category><title>What Putin's plans mean for Russia</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Putin's plans: What the Russian president's surprise means

Russia has a new prime minister, a change no-one predicted only a day ago. The long-serving Dmitry Medvedev has been replaced by a man most people had never heard of, until now.

Not only that, President Vladimir Putin has initiated a major reform of the constitution that looks like the start of his "transition": a much-anticipated plan to retain influence when he has to leave the Kremlin in 2024.

The details of that plan are still unclear, but this week's surprise shake-up offers curious new hints.

Why did the prime minister have to go?

Mr Medvedev's departure was a shock - or at the least, the timing of it. But it seems he's become his boss's fall guy, yet again.

He's long been a loyal sidekick to Vladimir Putin - most controversially when he kept the Kremlin warm, as president, for four years until the constitution allowed Mr Putin back in 2012. Now he's taking the rap for Russia's economic problems.

The patriotic "blip" over the 2014 annexation of Crimea has faded, and for many families there's no replacement balm for the harsh realities of life. Mr Putin's state of the nation speech this year recognised that, focusing heavily on welfare instead of sabre-rattling at the West.

So he's brought in a new man to sort out the economy, and state TV has been pumping out positive messages. Mikhail Mishustin, Russians are told, is experienced and able.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The previously unknown Mikhail Mishustin has been named as Russia's new prime minister

The shake-up buys time and goodwill ahead of next year's critical elections to parliament, where the main pro-Kremlin party, United Russia, is likely to struggle.

But it also helps buy support for Mr Putin's bigger changes.

What exactly does Mr Putin want to do the constitution?

Vladimir Putin is presenting his constitutional reform in the same vein as the prime minister swap.

The changes involve a rebalancing of responsibility - slightly less for the president, more for parliament. Mr Putin has explained it as bringing power closer to the people: MPs will get more say in forming the government, for example.

He argues it's more democratic, and will be more effective.

But most commentators see that as masking another agenda: Vladimir Putin carving out a suitable role for when he has to pack up and leave the Kremlin. After two decades in power he has interests and allies - a whole system - to protect. He may not want to bother himself any more with the day-to-day running of the country, but he's unlikely to fade away altogether.

The role of the little-noticed State Council could be central to his future.

Mr Putin is already its head, and now plans to enshrine the council in the constitution. It's just an advisory body for now. Souped-up, it could be a way to continue pulling the strings of power. Think Raul Castro, stepping back from the Cuban presidency, but still the powerful Communist Party GenSec. Or the Kazakh model, closer to home, where Nursultan Nazarbayev remained head of the security council and "Leader of the Nation" for life.

Vladimir Putin could be looking for his way to become Russia's supreme leader.

Can't he just stay on as president?

There was speculation that Mr Putin might simply remove the two-term limit for president in the constitution. Nothing is ever ruled out, but that would be highly controversial even in Russia's managed-democracy.

When Mr Putin and Dmitry Medvedev did their seat-swap back in 2012, it caused giant street protests. There were more pro-opposition rallies this summer.

The Kremlin probably wants to avoid more of the same, especially in a tough economic climate.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Dmitry Medvedev has long been loyal to President Putin

It's thought that Mr Putin is looking for a pliable replacement for himself instead: Putin II. There's still a chance Mr Medvedev could stage a comeback for that role. He's been side-lined, not shamed, after all. It's also possible the new Prime Minister Mishustin could be president-in-waiting. But after this week, Vladimir Putin seems more likely to surprise us.

How or when will we know about his plans?

Mr Putin still has four years in the job, so there's no major rush with the constitutional changes, although events have moved unusually fast lately.

He has set up a working group, 75-people strong, to draw up concrete proposals for the reforms, and has already given them their instructions. Around a giant table, Mr Putin warned the team to take care over "every letter, every comma", as their work concerns the fundamental law of the land.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The newly formed working group is in charge of amending the constitution

Once the proposals are done, his vision should be clearer. Some kind of public confirmation vote is expected before the summer. The Kremlin has ruled out a formal referendum, though. It would be risky.

Despite all the talk of democracy, Mr Putin wouldn't want his big plan - when it's finally presented - to be rejected.</text><tags>Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, Vladimir Putin, Mikhail Mishustin</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51024974<category>health</category><title>Hernia mesh implants used 'with no clinical evidence'</title><text>Image caption Roseanna Clarkin is now registered as disabled, after complications following her hernia mesh repair

"Too many" types of hernia mesh implants are being used on NHS patients with little or no clinical evidence, the BBC has been told.

New data shows more than 100 different types of mesh were purchased by NHS Trusts from 2012 to 2018 in England and Scotland, leading to fears over safety.

The meshes can cut into tissue and nerves, leaving some people unable to walk, work or care for children.

The regulator MHRA said there was a clinical need for the devices.

The new figures were taken from the responses of 56 of the 159 NHS Trusts that replied to a Freedom of Information request by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.

Currently, hernia mesh devices can be approved if they are similar to older products, which themselves may not have been required to undergo any rigorous testing or clinical trials in order to assess their safety or efficacy.

'Children want their mum back'

Hernia repair is one of the world's most common surgical procedure.

In England, around 100,000 such operations are performed each year, the majority using mesh. Many go well.

But the Victoria Derbyshire programme has heard from nearly 300 people who have experienced complications - including chronic pain, infections and organ perforations.

International guidelines estimate one in 10 patients will experience "significant chronic pain" following a mesh repair.

Roseanna Clarkin, from Glasgow, is now disabled. She had to give up her job due to complications after her repair.

She says she was initially told by doctors the pain was "in her head", and wanted to end her life because "nobody was listening".

It was only after seeing the programme's coverage of the mesh scandal that she discovered it had been used on her.

Aged 36, she said she was no longer able to look after her children as she had before.

"My kids wrote a letter saying they want their fun mum back," she said, breaking down in tears.

"My husband said he married a wife and became a carer. I shouldn't be living the life I'm living."

'Tested on rabbits'

There is a lot of secrecy surrounding the approval of hernia mesh, with even doctors unable to access the clinical data.

Prof Carl Heneghan, a medical device expert at the University of Oxford, explained that in some cases devices have only been required to be tested on animals - such as rabbits - for a short period of time, with the mesh being implanted and left in for several days.

"If there's no remaining immune reaction, you pass the test," he added.

Prof Heneghan described these tests as "completely inadequate" as they can't test for pain.

And he said there was "no chance" that the more than 100 types of device used on the NHS were all individually supported by medical evidence because there had not been 100 randomised trials in this area of medicine.

He has called for the NHS to "immediately" stop using those that have "no clinical evidence attached to them whatsoever" and said ideally trusts should only use two or three devices where the benefits are clear.

Hernia mesh implants are meant to be permanent but, when necessary, can be removed in some patients.

But of the patients the Victoria Derbyshire programme spoke to, most said they had been told there were no trained removal surgeons - or that they had been told removing the mesh could lead to further serious issues.

The programme has learned that one man died years after he developed an infection following his hernia mesh repair.

The hospital said in a letter to his wife that the mesh "could have been a cause of the infection".

One of the many causes of death given was chronic abdominal-wall infection.

'Hard as stone'

The BBC has also seen a leaked promotional video, probably for the medical community, funded by Ethicon - one of the biggest mesh manufacturers in the world.

In the footage, made over a decade ago, a surgeon is shown discussing how some older varieties of mesh can become "hard as stone" after only one year inside a patient and can cause damage to the body and chronic pain.

But the product featured is still being sold by Ethicon, and used by the NHS in England and Scotland.

In a statement, Ethicon did not comment on the video, but said it stood by the safety and performance of all its mesh products.

It also stressed the importance of looking at all clinical and scientific data before drawing conclusions about a device.

'Monitor for evidence'

Currently the use of mesh for vaginal repairs is suspended for most women in England, pending the outcome of a government review.

Its head, Lady Cumberlege, has said any recommendations made when it is published in March will also be relevant for hernia mesh.

No vaginal mesh implants have been carried out in Scotland since the chief medical officer announced a halt in 2018.

The director of devices at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Graeme Tunbridge, told the BBC: "The benefits and risks of using mesh for hernia repair have been considered in detail by clinicians and the professional bodies who represent them.

"We continue to monitor and review evidence as it becomes available and will take any appropriate action on that basis."

Mr Tunbridge said he recognised the system "does need strengthening" and said new legislation on medical devices would take effect from May 2020.

This will include strengthening the requirements on manufacturers to ensure that sufficient clinical evidence is in place for their products.

The Royal College of Surgeons of England said: "Our duty is to explain the options and risks to patients, so they can decide what the best course of action is for them."

It is campaigning to improve regulation and monitoring of new devices and implants.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: "On the rare occasion where a patient has suffered as a result of a mesh procedure, we are taking steps to improve patient safety - including improving how we listen to patients and how the system learns when concerns are raised."

"Exercise is my medication and motivation for life".

The inspirational words of 24-year-old Patrice Bromley-Robertson who undertook exercise to combat the symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome, which affects around one in five women in the UK.

Since adopting a fitness regime including home workouts, body weights and free weights, a routine scan discovered Patrice's cysts have since disappeared.

Her story is just one of many featured in Sport England's new television advert, as part of the revolutionary This Girl Can campaign.

The sport body's initiative is marking its fifth anniversary by showcasing "the raw unfiltered reality of women exercising in whatever way that works for them", including a breastfeeding mother who plays netball, a woman who clutches a hot water bottle to her abdomen and another whose tampon string is visible, highlighting the issues women face.

Here are the stories of some women featured in the groundbreaking campaign.

The mother and daughter who exercise together to manage their health conditions

Patrice's mother Yvonne, a 54-year-old mother-of-two, went through the menopause aged 45, and took up exercise seven years ago to battle weight gain, hot flushes and sleep disturbances.

The pair, from Haringey, London, regularly exercise together and motivate each other to keep fit, through home exercises and running.

"My body feels alive and I have so much more energy," said Yvonne.

"If you take at least one hour out of your busy schedule, I promise you will find the time to do more. If I can do it, anyone can, so go out there and smash it."

'I know now that I don't need to worry being judged, I just need to do me'

Glynis Evans swims twice a week at her local club

Glynis Evans, from Romford, is disabled and wears prosthetics, and finds swimming allows her to keep fit with less pain than traditional gym exercises.

The part-time teaching assistant started swimming in primary school and discovered it was the optimum exercise for her disability, but had to stop after several years due to routine changes as she got older.

In 2018, weight gain spurred Glynis on to make a return to the pool, but she found it difficult to commit to lessons and stopped going.

Last year, she took the plunge once more, making the brave decision to join her local swimming group for disabled people, which she continues to attend twice a week alongside around 20 members.

"Don't watch what anyone else is doing and just focus on yourself," she said.

New research from Sport England says more than half of women stop exercising, at least occasionally, because of worrying about what others think.

"I've always been wary of what other people think of me and I know that other people look at me and I've often felt judged," Glynis added.

"This year I hope to become an advocate to work with children to let kids know that they can be whatever they want to be.

"The sky is not the limit. Go further and beyond. Nothing is impossible."

How team sport helped a mum-of-three rediscover herself

Kirsti juggles being a mother to three children under six, but takes time to play netball in a team

Mother-of-three Kirsti Hau discovered her love for netball in school, but looking after a six-year-old, a four-year-old and a 10-month-old means life has got in the way of her hobbies.

After taking a break during each pregnancy, 37-year-old Kirsti eventually got back on the court more regularly, and plays competitively every weekend. Her motivation? Her older children cheering her on on the sidelines.

"It's all about taking small steps," Kirsti, who lives in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, said on how she juggles motherhood with fitness.

"There are loads of ways to get active. You can start off by doing a few bits at home (on apps or watching YouTube) that way you can build up the confidence at home.

"Once you're ready, you can find something in the community with like-minded women."

'You'll find that people are much more accepting than you think they're going to be'

Farrah encouraged women to 'not worry about what people think'

Farrah Herbert, from London, had been a keen climber for many years, but decided to take a break from the sport she loved. A few years later, she was invited to a group climbing trip which involved an overnight stay in a hostel.

Despite her initial reservations about the accommodation, Farrah overcame her fear and agreed to the trip, where she had a brilliant time meeting new people and re-discovering her love for the sport.

Since then, she has been on numerous similar trips, including a recent one-week climbing trip to Spain, and climbs a few times a week with her partner.

"You don't need to worry about what people might think, say or do," Farrah said. "There may be something holding you back from getting active, like fear of judgement, but most of the time it's much worse in your head than it is in reality.

"You just need to get out there and do it because it's not as bad as you think and you will enjoy it when you do it.

"Soon enough you forget there was ever a barrier there at all."</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26853788<category>world</category><title>South Africa to use flavoured condoms to tackle HIV</title><text>Image copyright AFP Image caption The condoms will be given out for free at universities and colleges

South Africa's government will distribute coloured and flavoured condoms among students to end "condom fatigue", the health minister has said.

Aaron Motsoaledi's comments came after a survey showed that condom usage had fallen in South Africa.

The decline in usage may be because "the standard-issued choice condoms just aren't cool enough", he added.

South Africa has some 6.4 million HIV-positive people - more than any other country.

The survey, by South Africa's Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), showed the rate of people with HIV had risen from 10.6% in 2008 to 12.2% in 2012.

HIV infection rate up from 10.6% in 2008 to 12.2%

2008: 85% of men and 66% of women used condoms

2012: Down to 67% and 50%

75% of those surveyed thought they had low risk of contracting HIV

10% of them already infected

This was because of the combined effects of "new infections and a successfully expanded antiretroviral treatment [ART] programme", the report said.

Many of those infected with HIV are living longer because they are being given treatment which a previous government refused to make available in state clinics.

Some two million people are now on the ART programme, however charities have warned that local clinics are running short of the drugs, Reuters news agency reports.

The latest study shows that condom use had declined, especially in the 15 to 24 age group.

The 2008 survey showed that 85% of males used them and 66% of females, but this had dropped to 67% and 50% respectively in 2012.

"The increases in some risky sexual behaviours are disappointing, as this partly accounts for why there are so many new infections still occurring," said Leickness Simbayi, an investigator on the study.

Some three-quarters of those surveyed said they had a low risk of contracting HIV, even though 10% were already infected.

In his response to the report, Mr Motsoaledi said: "We need to inject enthusiasm into the condom campaign, and we are about to start rolling out new types of free, coloured condoms which are also flavoured."

The condoms will be distributed for free at South Africa's universities and colleges, he added.</text><tags>South Africa</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/av/tennis/51128312<category>sport</category><title>I'm still capable - Clijsters' tennis comeback</title><text>Kim Clijsters, 36, tells BBC Sport that she may not be "as fit or as fast" as she used to be but she is "still capable of getting to a certain level" in tennis.

UFC 246: McGregor v Cerrone Date: Sunday 19 January (UK time) Venue: T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas Coverage: Approximately 03:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, then switching to BBC Radio 5 Live from 04:30. Also live text commentary on BBC Sport website.

Conor McGregor vowed to "remind everyone" how he "made this game" when he faces Donald Cerrone in his first fight in 15 months on Saturday.

At a news conference for his UFC 246 bout, McGregor also said he hoped to one day return to the boxing ring.

He has not fought in mixed martial arts since losing to Russian Khabib Nurmagomedov in 2018, and was convicted of assault in November last year.

"I'm in a good spot, I'm ready to fight," McGregor, 31, said.

"Sometimes we have to go to certain places in our life to realise what we need to do," the former two-weight UFC world champion added.

"I have turned over a new leaf. I feel the same young man but I feel re-energised and refreshed.

"I'm still a passionate young man, still reaching for the stars and aspiring to do things that have never been done before.

"There is no one who can touch me. I made this game what it is, so I am going to go in there and remind everyone."

Where was the chaos?

The shadow over Cerrone's face throughout the news conference sparked comment on Twitter

Since defeat by Nurmagomedov - a bout that ended in a mass brawl in the octagon - the Irishman has faced an assault charge and allegations of smashing a fan's phone.

His volatile behaviour, coupled with the colourful news conferences he has featured in previously, meant MMA fans were keen to see him conduct media duties opposite Cerrone in Las Vegas.

But the pair drew laughs rather than controversy, with McGregor complimenting the 36-year-old American's python-skin jacket.

"He has my respect and although there will be blood spilled on 18 January, it will not be bad blood," McGregor said. "And for the 'Mystic Mac' prediction, it will be a KO."

McGregor insisted he could read his rival "like a children's book". Cerrone, asked if he had any surprises in store for the Irishman in the octagon, simply replied: "He can read me so we'll see."

McGregor, who earned an estimated $100m when he briefly moved into boxing and lost to multi-weight world champion Floyd Mayweather in 2017, said he was interested in another foray into the sport.

"I'd love that Floyd rematch," McGregor said. "I thought I did very well, I think with some slight adjustments I'd have done even better.

"For me now, an aspiration of mine is to win a world boxing title. I think that would be a phenomenal feather in the cap."

Handshakes, hats but no hostility

Fans found Cerrone's outfit and the shadow cast over his face by his hat more entertaining than much of what was said, with one tweeting: "Donald Cerrone looks like a Mortal Kombat character you haven't unlocked yet."

One fan described the news conference as the "most boring" in UFC history, while others described McGregor's respectful manner as "kind of strange".

Former UFC fighter Dan Hardy on BBC Radio 5 Live: "McGregor was disappointing last time he was in the octagon. Since then people's opinions of him have changed and there's a lot of things to gain from a big, impressive win. The humble way he is acting will add to that if it comes with a victory."

MMA journalist Nick Peet on BBC Radio 5 Live: "I like the fact they were both respectful as it shows a new maturity to McGregor. I'd like to think he's matured and that the last 15 months or so have forced him to look in the mirror. He's a father now, he has all the money you'll ever need and his legacy is kind of assured anyway. He can only be back for one reason, to chase greatness. So I expected respect today."</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49746063<category>world</category><title>Chinese woman pleads guilty in 'birth tourism' case</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dongyuan Li trained clients in how to bypass US immigration

A Chinese woman has pleaded guilty in the US to federal charges of running a "birth tourism" scheme for Chinese nationals who paid so their children would be born American citizens.

Dongyuan Li admitted her company assisted wealthy Chinese nationals in getting to the US to give birth.

Ms Li would give clients training on how to bypass US immigration control and hide their pregnancies.

She amassed more than $3m (&#163;2.4m) in wire transfers.

Ms Li, who is due to be sentenced in December, could face up to 15 years in jail.

What was the scheme?

Ms Li admitted that between 2013 and 2015, her company You Win USA Vacation Services would charge Chinese nationals - including government officials - between $40,000 and $80,000 for coaching in how to have a baby in the US.

With that came the benefits of American citizenship.

On its website, the company boasted more than 500 customers. It said that being American was the "most attractive nationality" and it would ensure "priority for jobs in US government".

Ms Li told clients to initially fly from China to Hawaii due to the belief it would be easier to get past US customs. From there they could fly to Los Angeles where they would be housed in apartments.

She also admitted that the clients were coached on how to get through the US consulate interview in China, including by falsely stating that they were going to stay in the US for two weeks.

In reality, they planned to stay for up to three months to give birth.

What are the charges?

Ms Li pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud and one count of visa fraud.

As part of her plea deal with federal authorities, Ms Li gave up assets including $850,000, her house worth more than $500,000 and several Mercedes Benz cars.

Why was it illegal?

While it is not illegal to visit the US and give birth, making false visa claims is.

Authorities said Ms Li was promoting the benefits of having babies in the US, which would include helping to get family members immigration rights.

At a small, run-down training centre just to the north of Rio, Ane Marcelle dos Santos steadies her bow, carefully pulls an arrow from her quiver, pulls back the high-tension cord, pauses and shoots.

The arrow hits the target, way down the range - not quite in the middle, but still gold.

"I love this sport," Ane Marcelle tells me, "but I'm not sure if I can carry on doing this for much longer."

The 23-year-old came a creditable ninth in the women's archery at Rio 2016. Those were her first Games, and she's a genuine medal prospect for Tokyo 2020 - part of what should be Brazil's Olympic sporting legacy.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live Breakfast, Ane Marcelle explains how, less than a month after the Games ended, she lost most of her funding, her coach and other vital backing.

"The Brazilian Olympic Committee cut everything: my health insurance, my salary, everything," she says, barely able to contain her disappointment. "We made history in archery, achieving something no Brazilian had ever achieved. But it's all over. It made me think my sacrifice wasn't worth it."

Her story is not untypical for dozens, perhaps hundreds, of Brazilian athletes who face an uncertain future little more than six months after the jamboree that was Rio 2016.

Media playback is not supported on this device What has happened to the Rio Olympic venues?

By now the vast Olympic Park, built on the edge of a lagoon to the south of Rio, should have been up and running as a centre of excellence for Brazilian sport.

But the 'stage' which only six months ago was playing host to 'The Greatest Show on Earth' is eerily empty. Most of the venues are mothballed - empty, stripped bare of Rio 2016 logos and seating.

Arenas where medals were won and lost are now little more than warehouses. Venues that should have been dismantled and rebuilt as schools elsewhere in the city are untouched. If there is a legacy here, it's not the one those who campaigned for Rio to win the Games had expected.

"I feel the Olympic Games in Brazil were not so successful because the legacy was not the number one concern," says Isabel Swan, a three-time Olympic sailor and former medallist who was a key member of the team that 'won' the Games for Rio in 2009.

I've spoken to Swan on many occasions, particularly about the repeated failures of Rio state and city officials to keep their pre-Olympic pledge to clean the chronic levels of pollution and rubbish in Rio's Guanabara Bay.

When 5 live Breakfast caught up with her again this week, she was deflated but not broken.

She told me: "Even though we grew as a city and delivered some great sport, we still have big problems. This is making me really sad. But I'll keep believing and working. I won't change my mindset."

The Brazilian Ministry of Sport has had to take over the running of most of the venues in the Olympic Park - including the tennis centre, the velodrome and two of the three 'Carioca' arenas - because no private company, and certainly not the local authority, can take on the day-to-day expense of running them, never mind transforming the Park into a hive of sporting activity where the next generation of Brazilian athletes, like Ane Marcelle dos Santos, should be preparing to challenge for medals at the next Games.

Ane Marcelle dos Santos was beaten by Britain's Naomi Folkard at Rio 2016

"Our worst fears are becoming reality. We're showing a terrible example to the world."

That was the stark conclusion from Marcelo Barreto - one of Brazil's best-known and most experienced sports commentators - when he spoke to 5 live Breakfast.

"I think they made such a huge effort to take care of the Games themselves, all our efforts were exhausted when the Olympic flame was gone," said Barreto.

"When Rio won the right to hold the Olympics, Brazil was thriving&#8230; now it's a broken state. The government doesn't have money to pay teachers, health employees. Taking care of the Olympic legacy is at the very back of the line. We should have done much better."

No-one could, of course, have predicted back in 2009, when Rio won the right to host the Games, that by 2016 the city and the country would be in the depths of a political and economic crisis.

It would be churlish and misleading to blame the Olympics (and the 2014 football World Cup) for Brazil's many ills. But spending billions of dollars, in deals shrouded in allegations of corruption, on white elephant stadiums when public workers haven't received their salaries for months, doesn't look good to say the least.

"I'm not in disappointment mode yet because I think we still have time to regroup and fix the situation," said Mario Andrada, executive director for communications at Rio 2016.

"For a young democracy to successfully stage the Olympics and World Cup says quite a lot, and the fact the non-sporting legacy is already so strong means we can have a good, positive memory of the Games and will can be proud of the legacy."

The "non-sporting legacy" to which Andrada refers is the single new metro line between the city and the Olympic Park zone, some other new urban transport and the opening of other, previously derelict, city centre areas - things from which Rio has undoubtedly benefited.

But such was Rio's desperation to get things ready on time, legacy was the last thing on anyone's minds, one anonymous official, who'd worked previously on the London Games, told us. These were his words.

"I never once had a conversation about legacy at any point or in any discussion I had working on the Games. You have to remember this was a Games where we were scrambling to put the event on, on a day-to-day basis. There was no time to think about what was going to happen the day after the Games finished in September."

One of the four main venues used for Rio 2016 was the Deodoro outdoor complex on the outskirts of the city. It was where Team GB's women's hockey team struck gold, and the men's rugby side won silver.

Deodoro is located in Rio de Janeiro's West Zone

But Deodoro has long since been abandoned. There are 8ft high fences with padlocked gates surrounding the complex and promises this would be used for the greater good of the local community haven't been kept.

Among them is an already dilapidated BMX cycle track and the hugely expensive white water course. It was built for barely a week of competition and was meant to be transformed into an open-air swimming pool for locals after the Games.

The pool remains dry, unused and empty - yet another example of a Rio 2016 legacy that simply hasn't materialised.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50813696<category>world</category><title>Trump impeachment: What you need to know about the Senate trial</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer (left) and Republican leader Mitch McConnell (right) will be key players in the Senate trial

The US House of Representatives has impeached President Donald Trump, setting the stage for the third-ever Senate impeachment trial.

Here's how the process works.

Why is there a trial?

A trial in the Senate automatically follows a vote to impeach a president by the House, as decreed in the Constitution.

In President Trump's case, the House's articles of impeachment include two accusations: that he solicited a foreign country to help him politically, and that he obstructed Congress. The Republican president has denied any wrongdoing, calling the inquiry a "witch hunt".

Mr Trump is accused of withholding millions of dollars of military aid to Ukraine and using a proposed White House meeting with Ukraine's president as bargaining chips to push Ukraine to publicly announce an investigation into the president's leading Democratic rival Joe Biden. Democrats say this amounts to an abuse of presidential power.

After the White House refused to allow staff to testify at the impeachment hearings in the House, Democrats accused Mr Trump of obstructing Congress.

What's involved?

The Constitution is vague when it comes to impeachment - mandating simply that the House has the "sole power of impeachment", acting as grand jury and bringing charges. The Senate is given "the sole power to try all impeachments" and convict a president of "treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanours".

There are general rules largely based on President Andrew Johnson's trial, but ultimately, Republican leader Mitch McConnell and his Democratic counterpart Chuck Schumer will have to determine the guidelines for evidence, witnesses, duration and arguments.

While Mr McConnell has the final say over the format as the Republican Senate leader, he could find his options limited if Democrats pressure moderate Republicans to vote with them on any changes to the rules. At any point, senators can call for votes on trial procedures that would need a simple majority to pass.

After lawmakers hear from both sides - House prosecutors and White House counsel - and any witnesses, they will be given a full day to deliberate before a vote on conviction is held.

A two-thirds majority is required to convict and oust Mr Trump. Given that Republicans control the 100-seat chamber with a 53-47 majority, the president is widely expected to be acquitted.

Who's who?

Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts will preside over the trial in the Senate, but the senators ultimately will act as both judge and jury. Justice Roberts is there to make sure the trial adheres to the predetermined rules, but if any vote during the trial ends in a tie, he has the final say.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in January selected a group of Democrats to act as impeachment managers - essentially prosecutors for the House. These lawmakers will present the lower chamber's case for impeachment to the Senate. They include Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler.

For Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, Republicans had 13 such managers; including South Carolina and now staunch Trump ally Lindsey Graham.

Mr McConnell, the majority leader, will ultimately have sway over the format and guidelines of the trial.

He provoked condemnation from senior Democrats when he told Fox News he would act in lockstep with the White House. "Everything I do during this, I'm coordinating with the White House counsel. There will be no difference between the president's position and our position as to how to handle this to the extent that we can," he said.

Will senators get to ask questions?

Senators can ask questions of witnesses or counsellors, but only by submitting them in writing to Justice Roberts. Witnesses may not necessarily appear on the Senate floor. They can be interviewed by a committee of lawmakers with footage of the testimony aired during the trial instead.

Democrats want several senior White House officials to testify, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and ex-adviser John Bolton. But there may not be any witnesses at all if Republicans decide they would rather keep the trial short, despite Mr Trump's calls for the Bidens and the whistleblower who sparked the Ukraine inquiry to appear.

In December, Mr McConnell suggested as much, saying the senate's duty was to "act as judge and jury to hear a trial, not to rerun the entire fact-finding investigation". "We do not need jurors to start brainstorming witness lists for the prosecution," he said.

Mr Clinton's trial had no live witnesses.

Want to know more?

Will Trump give evidence?

While the president could choose to appear before the Senate himself, it is much more likely he will have White House lawyer Pat Cipollone speak on his behalf.

Mr Cipollone, like the impeachment managers, will be able to question witnesses and deliver opening and closing statements.

US media report Mr Trump may also bring some House conservatives onto his defence team, like Ohio congressman Jim Jordan or John Ratcliffe of Texas.

Will Biden or his son have to testify?

That will depend on what Mr McConnell chooses for the trial format. US media report Republicans are still debating if it is worth it to summon the Democratic former vice-president and his son as the president wants.

Mr Biden has dismissed calls for his testimony, telling NPR it is an attempt by the president to "divert attention" from the accusations against him.

"This is a Trump gambit he plays," Mr Biden said. "I will not yield to what everybody is looking for here. And that is to take the eye off the ball."

How long might this all take?

After the House presents the articles of impeachment to the Senate, they must consider them in session every day, except Sunday, until the final decision.

Mr Schumer has offered a tentative schedule for the trial, which would be the first order of business in the new year. In total, he has suggested some 126 hours of proceedings.

The trial is likely to take weeks but how many is anybody's guess. Democrats will hope it is all done by the time the 2020 primary elections begin in February.</text><tags>Impeachment of Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Donald Trump, United States, Impeachment of Donald Trump</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-43170408<category>world</category><title>The 'water war' brewing over the new River Nile dam</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images

A new dam on the Nile could trigger a war over water unless Ethiopia can agree a deal with Egypt and Sudan, writes the BBC's Africa Correspondent Alastair Leithead.

It is often said the world's next world war will be fought over water and there are few places as tense as the River Nile.

Egypt and Ethiopia have a big disagreement, Sudan is in the middle, and a big geopolitical shift is being played out along the world's longest river.

There's been talk about a dam on the Blue Nile for many years, but when Ethiopia started to build, the Arab Spring was underway and Egypt was distracted.

"Egypt was the gift of the Nile" the pharaohs said, and they worshiped the river as a god.

Join the BBC's Africa correspondent Alastair Leithead and his team, travelling from the Blue Nile's source to the sea - through Ethiopia and Sudan into Egypt.

For thousands of years, and more recently buoyed by British colonialism, Egypt has wielded political influence over the Nile.

But the ambition of Ethiopia is changing all that.

There are few African countries with a plan to deal with the doubling of the continent's population over the next 30 years.

Yet despite its political challenges and its limited freedoms, industrial parks are being built as Ethiopia seeks to transform itself into a middle-income country, and so it needs electricity.

Africa's largest hydroelectric power station and one of the world's largest dams will do that, but with 85% of the river emerging from the Ethiopian highlands, Egypt is concerned its rival has the capability to control the flow of the river.

"It's one of the most important flagship projects for Ethiopia," says Seleshi Bekele, the country's Minister for Water, Irrigation and Electricity.

"It's not about control of the flow, but providing opportunity for us to develop ourselves through energy development. It has a lot of benefit for the downstream countries."

And Sudan certainly welcomes it.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is just a few kilometres from the border and the pylons are already in place, waiting for the power generation to begin and for cheap, renewable power to fizz through the cables.

Image caption The new dam will mean the river flows year-round

Dams also regulate the flow of the river.

At the moment the difference between high water and low water level in Sudan is 8m, and that makes its vast irrigation projects harder to manage.

With the dam in place, the difference will be 2m and the flow of the river will come year-round.

"For Sudan it's wonderful," says says Osama Daoud Abdellatif, the owner of the Dal Group which runs farms and irrigation projects.

"It's the best thing that's happened for a long time and I think the combination of energy and regular water levels is a great blessing."

He understands that Egypt is worried, as the UN predicts the country will start suffering water shortages by 2025.

"The Nile is the lifeline of Egypt, so for them, I wouldn't say they are paranoid, but they are very concerned about anything that you do with that water."

Any threat to Egypt's water is considered a threat to its sovereignty.

"It's very much a game changer, a new order is beginning in the whole region now," believes Rawia Tawfik, an Egyptian academic working in Germany.

"Ethiopia for the first time is combining both the physical power of being an upstream country that can in one way or another control the River Nile's flow, and the economic power of being able to construct a dam depending on its own domestic resources."

And Egypt's minister of water resources and irrigation, Mohamed Abdel Aty, is extremely angry.

"We are responsible for a nation of about 100 million", he says. "If the water that's coming to Egypt reduced by 2% we would lose about 200,000 acres of land.

"One acre at least makes one family survive. A family in Egypt is average family size about five persons. So this means about one million will be jobless.

"It is an international security issue."

Hydroelectric power stations do not consume water, but the speed with which Ethiopia fills up the dam will affect the flow downstream.

They would like the water to be generating power as soon as possible, but it should take time to fill up a reservoir which is going to be bigger than Greater London and will flood the Nile for 250km (155 miles) upstream.

If it is filled within three years the level of the river will be affected, but over six or seven years it won't have a major impact on water level.

Negotiations between Egypt and Ethiopia are not going well.

The discussions aren't even at the stage of assessing the impact, but are still about how that will be determined.

Sudan and Egypt are also at loggerheads over how much water Sudan uses - and how that amount may increase when the dam is finished.

The irony is Egypt did in the 1960s exactly what Ethiopia is doing today, when it built the Aswan High Dam.

For a revolutionary post-colonial country it was a proud national achievement, and Ethiopia sees it in the same way.

Ethiopia wants to pay for this project itself without international help.

Government workers are giving a month's salary a year to the project - and not all are happy about that.

There is a lottery to fund the dam and bonds are being put up for sale.

Image caption A fisherman in Ethiopia carries his catch from the river

The dam is impressive. After five years it is two-thirds finished - and it already crosses the river.

There is nothing Egypt can do about it, except take military action which would be extreme.

That is why diplomacy and collaboration are the only means of resolving this issue.

But when issues like nationalism and the relative strength and importance of countries is concerned, it muddies the water.

The world's first war over water can be avoided on the Nile, and it could even be an example of how to resolve complex disagreements over water.

But it will take a lot more effort to navigate an agreement between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt.</text><tags>Nile, Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13313370<category>world</category><title>Egypt country profile</title><text>Long known for its ancient civilisation, Egypt is the largest Arab country and has played a central role in Middle Eastern politics in modern times.

In the 1950s President Gamal Abdul Nasser pioneered Arab nationalism and the non-aligned movement, while his successor Anwar Sadat made peace with Israel and turned back to the West.

Egypt's teeming cities - and almost all agricultural activity - are concentrated along the banks of the Nile, and on the river's delta. Deserts occupy most of the country.

The economy depends heavily on agriculture, tourism, and cash remittances from Egyptians working abroad, mainly in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries.

However, rapid population growth and the limited amount of arable land are straining the country's resources and economy, and political unrest has often paralysed government efforts to address the problems.

LEADERS

President: Abdel Fattah al-Sisi

Image copyright Getty Images

Retired Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was elected president in May 2014, almost a year after he removed his elected predecessor, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi, from office in a coup.

He had served as armed forced chief under Mr Morsi, and was a key figure in the interim government which took over after the ouster.

Some Egyptians celebrated the possibility that Mr Sisi would bring stability to a country in upheaval since the removal of long-term leader Hosni Mubarak during the Arab Spring uprising in 2011. Others worry that he represents a return to the authoritarian security state that prevailed under Mr Mubarak.

Mr Sisi won a second four-year-term in March 2018 against a sole minor opposition candidate. Human rights lawyer Khalid Ali and former prime minister Ahmad Shafiq withdrew from the race, and the former armed forces chief of staff Sami Anan was arrested.

In addition to Egypt's struggling economy, President Sisi also has to deal with an Islamist insurgency on its borders with Israel and Gaza.

MEDIA

Egypt is a major regional media player. Its TV and film industries supply much of the Arab-speaking world with content and its press is influential.

TV is the favourite medium and there are several big hitters in the sector, including the state broadcaster.

The authorities have been increasing controls over traditional and social media to an unprecedented degree.

Reporters Without Borders says Egypt is "one of the world's biggest prisons" for journalists.

Time-lapse footage has captured a lightning storm swirling in dark clouds around the peak of the Taal volcano in the Philippines.

The volcano had spewed a giant plume of ash, prompting thousands of people to be evacuated.

Officials said the plume from the Taal volcano stretched 1km (0.6 miles) into the sky.

Cyber-security experts are urging Windows 7 users to upgrade their operating system.

Microsoft is going to stop supporting Windows 7 from Tuesday so that it can focus on "newer technologies".

As a result, Windows 7 users will no longer receive the all-important security updates and patches that keep their machines safe.

One in four Windows users is running Windows 7, according to statistics website StatCounter.

What does this all mean?

It means that Microsoft is ending the cat-and-mouse game with hackers seeking to exploit software bugs in the Windows 7 operating system.

If perpetrators find a flaw in Windows 7, Microsoft will not fix it.

Without continued software and security updates, Windows 7 machines are more likely to be infected with viruses and malware, Microsoft wrote on its website.

"Running an unpatched machine means that the flaws in the code will never be fixed and as exploits for those flaws become known and widespread, your chances of being successfully attacked grow very rapidly," said Rik Ferguson, vice-president of security research at Trend Micro.

David Emm, a senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, added that people need to move to a supported operating system as soon as possible.

What are the risks?

Hackers use malware to invade, damage or disable computers.

It can be used to steal personal and financial data, spy on other users without them knowing, and to hold companies to ransom until a payment is made.

In May 2017, the NHS was hit by the WannaCry ransomware attack.

A government report in 2018 concluded that the attack could have been avoided if NHS Trusts had updated their computers and applied the necessary security patches.

Hackers exploited weaknesses in unpatched versions of Windows 7, as well as to a lesser extent the earlier Windows XP, which Microsoft had stopped supporting.

What should you do with your Windows 7 PC?

Computers running Windows 7 will still function after Tuesday but they will become less and less secure.

Microsoft is urging people to move to Windows 10, a newer operating system that it sells for &#163;120.

"Going forward, the best way for you to stay secure is on Windows 10," it said. "And the best way to experience Windows 10 is on a new PC."

It is possible to install Windows 10 on old PCs but Microsoft warns that it may not run smoothly.

In order to run Windows 10, PCs must have a 1GHz processor, 16GB of hard drive space, and 1GB of RAM memory.

"While it is possible to install Windows 10 on your older device, it is not recommended," Microsoft said.

That said, Windows 7 users do not need to upgrade if they use their PC offline.

What do UK officials say?

UK authorities have warned Windows 7 users not to do internet banking or send emails after Tuesday.

The warning was issued by the National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of Britain's intelligence agency GCHQ, and first reported by The Telegraph,.

"We would urge those using the software after the deadline to replace unsupported devices as soon as possible, to move sensitive data to a supported device and not to use them for tasks like accessing bank and other sensitive accounts," an NCSC spokesperson told the BBC.

"They should also consider accessing email from a different device."

What about for businesses?

Some companies rely heavily on applications that only work with Windows 7.

Businesses can pay Microsoft if they want to continue getting updates for Windows 7 Professional or Windows 7 Enterprise.

The Windows 7 Extended Security Updates will be available until 2023 for businesses of all sizes.

Charges range from $25 (&#163;19) per device to $200 per device and increase each year. The costs will mount quickly for organisations with lots of computers.

For businesses, it is not always easy to upgrade to a newer operating system, Mr Ferguson said.

"There may be business-critical applications that will not run on newer operating systems, or there may be significant costs associated with upgrading those applications," he said.

Places like hospitals and factories may have equipment that is designed to run exclusively on Windows 7.

"The user is not always able to upgrade without voiding the warranty," said Mr Ferguson.</text><tags>Cyber-security, Microsoft, Software</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48950103<category>technology</category><title>Google's DeepMind goes undercover to battle gamers</title><text>Image copyright Blizzard Image caption AlphaStar can play as any one of Starcraft II's three races

Gamers in Europe are being invited to take on a bot developed by some of the world's leading artificial intelligence researchers.

But there's a twist: players will not be told when they have been pitted against it.

The tests are being carried out by DeepMind, the London-based AI company that previously created a program that defeated the world's top Go players.

In this case, the challenge involves the sci-fi video game Starcraft II.

It is seen as being a more complex task, since players can only get a partial overview of what their opponent is doing, unlike the Chinese board game Go where all the pieces are on show.

In addition, both Starcraft players move their armies about simultaneously rather than by taking turns.

DeepMind - which is owned by Google's parent Alphabet - has said its bot AlphaStar is playing anonymously so as to get as close to a normal match situation as possible. The concern is that if people knew for sure that they were playing against a computer, they might play differently.

But gamers will only face the algorithm-controlled system if they have first opted in to be part of the experiment.

Image copyright Blizzard Image caption DeepMind is not saying when or how often it will deploy its AlphaStar agent against human players

There is a risk that if they lose, then their Match Making Rating (MMR) score will suffer, reducing their ranking against other players and affecting their likelihood of being promoted to higher leagues.

One of the UK's leading players said there was a lot of interest among the Starcraft community as to how AlphaStar would perform.

"It's a game of hidden information and making decisions with very limited knowledge," explained Raza Sekha, from Kent.

"People are very curious to see whether DeepMind will innovate and come up with new strategic thoughts.

"That would be a really great achievement, but I don't think many people are expecting it to happen."

AlphaStar's predecessors have, however, come up with creative strategies within the games of chess, Go and shogi, which have in turn influenced some of the top human players to change their own tactics.

Reinforcement learning

This is not the first time AI researchers have sought to advance the field via video games.

Last year, San Francisco-based OpenAI reported a breakthrough when it effectively created a "curious" agent to achieve high scores within Montezuma's Revenge.

Image copyright OpenAI Image caption Despite being an ancient video game, researchers had struggled to teach AI agents to explore Montezuma's Revenge's rooms

A range of machine learning experiments have also been carried out within Minecraft, thanks to Microsoft developing a special version of its block-building title.

And DeepMind itself rose to prominence by developing agents that taught themselves how to play dozens of Atari games including Breakout and Space Invaders. More recently it created software that plays alongside human team-mates within Quake III Arena.

These ready-made virtual environments provide a way to carry out a process called reinforcement learning. This involves agents discovering ways to perform better by themselves via a process of trial and error, receiving "rewards" for success rather than being told what to do.

In some cases, agents teach themselves from scratch. But in AlphaStar's case, it was first trained to imitate human play by referencing past matches, before being unleashed against other versions of itself to further improve performance.

Handicapped AI

AlphaStar's progress has not been without controversy.

Some players felt that it had an unfair advantage in earlier matches because it could look at a game's entire map at once, taking in more detail than a human could.

"As a human, one of the hardest parts of the game is multitasking," explained Mr Sekha.

"It's really hard to split your attention between two places.

Image copyright DeepMind Image caption DeepMind intends to release replays of the matches versus humans when it publishes its research

"So, an AI has a crucial advantage when it can see everywhere at once, as that lets it attack and defend almost at the same time, whereas a human would have to choose whether it's best to do one or the other."

To tackle this, the agent has been tweaked to use the game's map more like humans do. It now has to zoom in to a section to determine the action within, and can only move units to locations in view.

DeepMind has also reduced the number of actions AlphaStar can take per minute to address other criticism.

But Mr Sekha said there were still unanswered questions.

"If it can switch very quickly from one camera to another camera, much faster than a human could, that would still be a bit unfair," he said.

"So it will be really interesting to see what steps they have taken to level the playing field, because last time the community felt it was a bit too much in favour of the artificial intelligence."

DeepMind intends to share more details about the project as part of a scientific research paper, but has yet to determine when it will be published.</text><tags>Alphabet, Google, Artificial intelligence, Gaming</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51137210<category>uk</category><title>'My sister died after taking a line of cocaine'</title><text>Image copyright Family handout Image caption When Stacey reached the hospital, she found her sister Lucy (pictured) unrecognisable

Stacey Jordan still wonders whether she could have done more to save her sister.

Lucy White was just 24 when she died in hospital in summer 2018 after a line of cocaine triggered a heart attack and then a coma.

Lucy, a student from Bristol, had been introduced to cocaine by her mother, a long-term drug user - but Stacey had managed to get Lucy clean, before she relapsed, a few months before her death.

When Stacey got to the hospital she found her sister, almost unrecognisable.

"I should have been more strict," she says 18-months on. "You look back now and you're like, 'She was hiding from me. She was avoiding me for a reason.'

"But could I see it? Maybe not. Did I want to see it? That's maybe the question."

Figures compiled for BBC News by NHS Digital show Lucy's story is far from unusual, with record levels of cocaine use putting increasing pressure on the NHS in England.

The figures indicate:

a 76% increase in hospital admissions caused by cocaine since 2014-15

a 70% rise in admissions due to mental disorders linked to cocaine use

people aged 30-39 have seen the largest increase in admissions

the area with the highest admission rates is Merseyside

Lewis, a 25-year-old from the Midlands, also suffered a heart attack after a line of cocaine.

"My friend's a nurse and she was taking my pulse and she's whispering, 'Call an ambulance.' My heart is pounding out of my chest."

Image caption Lewis was spending up to &#163;300 a week on cocaine

He had taken the drug numerous times before but on this occasion it reacted badly with his system and he needed medical treatment.

He recovered fully and his cocaine use, which he admits once used to cost him &#163;200 to &#163;300 a week, has dramatically reduced in the past year.

"It wasn't making me happy at all," says Lewis of his drug habit. "It's the worst paranoia I've had in my life.

"I'd be sat by my window, a car would pull up and I'd be looking over my shoulder. I'd fear my girlfriend was cheating on me."

Image caption Dealers are now marketing cocaine, once seen as mainly for rich people, more widely

The increased need for the NHS to treat cocaine users comes as the number of people dying after taking the drug hits record levels.

Since 2015, cocaine-related deaths have tripled in Scotland and doubled in England and Wales.

Cocaine in Britain is purer, more available and consumed more widely than ever before.

Image caption Former professional footballer Colin McNair says addiction destroyed his career

"From the age of 15 we've supported people to try to help them address their cocaine use," says Eddie Buggy, a drugs worker in Hamilton, Lanarkshire, with the drug charity Addaction.

"It's easier to buy than alcohol, you don't have to go into a shop.

"You can use digital platforms to get it which young people are very familiar with - Snapchat, Whatsapp, stuff like that."

'Destroyed my career'

The increased availability is driven in part by dealers marketing more widely a drug once seen as mainly for rich people.

Several strands with different levels of purity are now sold, costing anything from &#163;100 a gram down to as little as &#163;30 a gram.

The sheer amount of cocaine in Lanarkshire, indeed across Scotland, has led to Hamilton Academical Football Club taking a leading role in warning teenagers of the dangers of drug abuse.

The club's chief executive, Colin McGowan, himself a former drug and alcohol addict, has set up an anti-addiction charity, which goes into local schools educating youngsters.

Image caption As part of his talk to teenagers, Colin McNair shows the effect on his body of two decades of drug use

On a recent Friday, Colin gave a talk at Our Lady's High School in Motherwell accompanied by Colin McNair, a former professional footballer with Hearts, Falkirk and Motherwell whose life spiralled out of control and ended up in prison after he took a line of cocaine in his early 20s.

"People who are not into drugs can't understand it, 'You actually threw all that away?'" he says.

"I didn't throw it away. When you are caught up in addiction, your choices are taken from you.

"That's how strong and powerful cocaine is."</text><tags>Drug use, Drugs trade</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51142210<category>world</category><title>Putin's plans: What Russian president's surprise means</title><text>Video

It can be tricky to predict what Vladimir Putin will do next. Now the Russian president has delivered a surprise by announcing big plans to change the constitution.

Not only that, the government has quit and the country's got a new prime minister.

There is a data revolution transforming just about every aspect of our lives. And on Tech Tent this week we look at two areas - surveillance and health - where we have rather different attitudes to how our personal data is used.

When it comes to the mass retrieval of facial recognition data and its use in security and surveillance, China certainly leads the way. It has been used everywhere from schools to shops to public parks, to verify identity.

But two developments this week have tested the patience of Chinese consumers.

First, a new rule came in obliging anyone registering a new Sim card for a mobile phone to supply a facial recognition scan.

Then, the city of Zhengzhou became the first in the country to introduce facial recognition to its metro system, meaning travellers will be able to pay for journeys just by having their faces scanned.

Social media in China has plenty of built-in censorship, but Kerry Allen, China media analyst for BBC Monitoring, says people have been quite unrestrained in their criticism of the advance of facial recognition.

"They are worried that China is trying to be ahead of the times at the expense of ensuring that the [relevant] security is in place," she explains.

We may think that privacy in China is not as big an issue as in Europe or the United States, but comments on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter or Facebook, make it clear that it is a growing concern for many.

"They are saying things like 'this is like Big Brother... I'm very concerned that people might be able to steal my facial data and find out where I live. It used to be the case that people might find out my phone number and I'd get crank calls. Nowadays, they might find out my face and find out everything about me'."

But if people in China and elsewhere are increasingly concerned about handing over their biometric information, what about supplying data for health research?

Valverde had just witnessed Barcelona's best performance of the season against Atletico Madrid in the semi-finals of the Spanish Super Cup (75 minutes of excellent football that ended up in defeat), had the club top of La Liga, unbeaten in the league since 2 November and in the last 16 of the Champions League, having finished top of a group that included Borussia Dortmund and Inter Milan.

On the face of it, it might seem a bizarrely-timed decision. But this is Barcelona we are talking about.

Why this came as a surprise to no-one - Valverde included

For some time now, the 55-year-old Valverde has been spoken to by the movers and shakers at the club over matters that have been concerning them regarding the team's form.

Many feel the side is going backwards, there are doubts being expressed about the physical preparation of the players and the substitutions during games, rumours of a charged atmosphere in the dressing room are rife and there seems to be a lethargy, complacency and general malaise about the place.

That is how it is explained from the club, who keep pointing to the painful Champions League surrenders of the past two seasons - against Roma and Liverpool - as proof Valverde could not take the team to the next level.

There is of course another side to the story. Valverde had to start his time at the Nou Camp by managing the departure of Neymar.

"The Brazilian is about to leave," star player Lionel Messi told him during his first pre-season, the first news he had heard of what was going to be confirmed weeks later.

That season he ended up with a league and cup double. There was a second league title but Valverde could only work with the cards he had been dealt.

He inherited a changing room whose main characters are over 30, which is used to doing things its own way, that does not like to be challenged, had signings that did not work (Philippe Coutinho because of his personality, Ousmane Dembele because of his physique, Arthur because of his lack of focus) and a chairman who kept sacking directors of football without a clear idea of where to go.

The surprise perhaps is not that it has happened, but that is has taken so long to come to fruition.

So who was in contention for the job?

Valverde signed a contract extension until 2021 in February, apparently to quash rumours about his impending departure.

There was enough evidence in place even after the club's 3-0 victory over Liverpool - never mind the capitulation at Anfield that followed soon after - to suggest there was a worrying lack of dynamism, defensive structure, discipline and basic energy required to go toe to toe with a side like Jurgen Klopp's.

Despite the defeat in the cup final against Valencia and the desire of many within the club to part company with the manager, both parties decided to go on one more season.

But as far back as the beginning of November, just after they had lost 3-1 to Levante, the club approached former player Thierry Henry, only to be informed he had already signed a deal to join Montreal Impact. The Frenchman was told Valverde's days were numbered.

When they went to meet club legend Xavi last Friday in Qatar, where he is manager of Al Sadd, they announced they were going to watch Dembele, who also just happened to be recovering from injury in the country.

Xavi has been in charge of Qatari side Al Sadd since May

But the meeting took place the day after the Spanish Super Cup defeat by Atletico and, despite the doubts for months about Valverde, there was a look of political improvisation about the encounter between Xavi and the club (chief executive Oscar Grau and sporting director Eric Abidal).

It brought to mind what took place when the club tried to make the right noises and look as interested as they could in re-signing Neymar from PSG without actually doing so. Or wanting to do so.

Xavi struggled with his decision because the club he loves approached him but he was not convinced himself of exactly what they wanted.

Two things eventually led to him turning down the offer: the unstable situation at the club with presidential elections in 2021 and the arrival into the scenario of a presidential candidate called Victor Font, who has already declared that if he wins he would make Xavi the new club coach.

Many believe it is actually the other way around, with Xavi deciding that new blood like Font and a new regime might be needed in the boardroom at the Nou Camp.

Also Xavi needed time to think. He believed next summer could have been his moment if Barcelona had given him total control over football matters, and he was planning to bring in top people he trusts.

Not any more it seems; for now that ship has sailed, with the announcement from the club that Setien has signed until 2022. Any suspicions that 'negotiations' with the former Barcelona legend had been nothing more than political expediency now seem likelier than ever to have some truth to them.

Before Setien's signing another former Barca player, the ex-Everton manager Ronald Koeman, also turned down their offer to take the job until the end of the season. And they also approached Mauricio Pochettino, recently sacked by Tottenham.

Ramon Planes - who used to work at Pochettino's former club Espanyol and now is part of Barcelona's technical department - and club president Josep Maria Bartomeu are both close friends of Pochettino and in constant contact.

For them to approach the available Argentine coach, it was probably because they thought they had half a chance of him saying yes.

Unfortunately, probably because of his long history with Espanyol, Pochettino has an entire back catalogue of statements he has made proclaiming why he would never take the Barcelona job and the likelihood of him doing so will always be remote.

That said, being seen as a suitable candidate for such a prestigious appointment certainly isn't going to do him any harm in his quest to eventually take charge at one of Europe's top clubs, something he will undoubtedly do at some time in the near future.

What will Setien bring to the Barcelona table?

Setien (right) had been Betis manager since 2017 and led them to sixth and 10th-place finishes in La Liga

Where Setien is a perfect fit is in his unquestioned zeal alongside coaches like Pep Guardiola and Oscar Garcia, currently at Celta Vigo, for the Johan Cruyff possession game, much loved and oft-perfected in the past by Barcelona.

On taking the Betis job, Setien revealed in an interview with El Periodico that despite his love for football he didn't really understand it "until I saw the football of Johan Cruyff".

"It was with coaches like him when I began to get it," he continued. "When to touch the ball, to pass, the spaces... this is what I try to communicate to the players, to keep the ball and to run as little as possible after it."

He added he would have had his little finger cut off to be given the chance to play for one of Cruyff's sides, "not because I wanted to be a Barcelona footballer, but rather because of the way they played because I could see just how much the footballers were enjoying themselves".

His teams in the lower leagues were often referred to as the Barcelona of those divisions. It takes a while to convince the players and even more the fans, and he never completely managed the audience at Betis where, in truth, he never really had the depth of talent that he could trust in to carry out his plans to maximum effect.

Barcelona should prove an easier sell.

On the minus side he is already 61 years old and lacks extensive top-flight experience with Betis being, until now, by some distance the biggest managerial job he has held. But he is not after a career, he just wants to see if he can get his approach, so familiar to the club, to work.

But it isn't in the passing aspect of the game where he could potentially be let down but rather in the work rate of the players without the ball, which is precisely where Valverde was hung out to dry by some of his team.

This side has the look and feel of the dressing room at the end of the Frank Rijkaard era, when I remember the likes of Xavi and Andres Iniesta telling me they were losing their love for the game. Drastic measures had to be taken by Pep Guardiola in order to go on to achieve what he later did.

Will Setien have the same passion and desire and be able to do what Valverde decided not to do, namely change the culture and dynamic of the dressing room? Will he be able to do what Guardiola did? It will be easier said than done.

Drax, which generates 5% of the UK's power, has said it plans to capture more carbon than it produces by 2030.

The firm's power plant in North Yorkshire is already largely powered by renewable fuel such as wood pellets.

But now it hopes to scale up a system that will allow it to capture millions of tons of carbon emissions from the plant.

However, the scheme will require its government subsidies - currently due to expire in 2027 - to be extended.

Drax, which is the UK's largest power station, used to run exclusively on coal, but it has converted four of its six units to burn wood as the country seeks to end its dependence on finite fossil fuels.

The firm said it plans to cut emissions in two ways. First, the sustainably farmed trees that provide its wood pellets absorb carbon emissions as they grow.

The second takes place at the power plant site as carbon-capture technology traps the emissions created by burning the wood.

At present, a pilot project at the site captures a tonne of carbon each day.

But Drax said it hopes to install the system at two of its units by the end of the next decade, removing eight million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.

It also plans to close the two remaining coal-generating units at its North Yorkshire plant by 2025, although the company did not say how that would affect power output.

Biomass power generation has proved controversial with some environmental campaigners.

A Chatham House report from 2017 suggests burning wood is not carbon-neutral, as young trees planted as replacements absorb and store less carbon than the ones that have been burned. Others say it can lead to deforestation.

But Drax defends the sustainability record of its biomass supply chain.

However, the firm has yet to secure the subsidies it needs to help grow its carbon capture project to a scale that could make a difference to the UK's climate ambitions.

The firm currently receives around &#163;2m a day from the state to support its green transition, but this support will run out in less than 10 years.

Prof Nilay Shah, head of the chemical engineering department at Imperial College London, told the BBC the country would need to produce up to 150 million tonnes of "negative emissions" to meet its net zero target.

Drax boss Will Gardiner said: "The UK Government is working on a policy and investment framework to encourage negative emissions technologies, which will enable the UK to be home to the world's first carbon negative company.

"This is not just critical to beating the climate crisis, but also to enabling a just transition, protecting jobs and creating new opportunities for clean growth - delivering for the economy as well as for the environment."</text><tags>Climate change, Renewable energy, Carbon capture and storage, Drax Group, Climate change</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-48880939<category>uk</category><title>Brexit: EU subsidy loss 'could wipe out farms'</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Farmers across the UK last year received over &#163;3.5bn in EU subsidies

With three months to go before the UK could leave the European Union (EU), farmers say they still face uncertainty about future subsidy levels.

Last year farmers received &#163;3.5bn in financial support through the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).

One farmer from York said he feared farms could soon be "wiped out like the coal industry".

The government said farmers had been told subsidy levels would be maintained until the next general election.

But the National Audit Office said farmers had been left unable to plan for the future and the main farming union called for "cast-iron commitments" from the government.

'Pick NHS over farmers'

CAP funding is one of the EU's biggest policies with a Europe-wide budget worth more than &#163;50bn a year.

The subsidies are designed to support the farming industry and help farmers and landowners maintain their land.

Some farmers have said without long-term guarantees about future subsidy levels, farms could disappear from the landscape.

"We could be wiped out like the coal industry," said Roger Hobson, whose 4,500-acre farm near York qualifies for a subsidy worth &#163;100,000 a year.

"This is not just about growing food, these subsidies help us improve the landscape and protect endangered species.

"What we fear is that in the future the farm industry will have to go to the government and compete for funding alongside the NHS and other public services.

"In that situation the government is always going to pick the NHS over farmers."

Image caption Roger Hobson farms 4,500 acres in Yorkshire

Analysing more than 175,000 individual payments made to farmers in the UK last year, BBC News has found:

Farmers and landowners received &#163;3.5bn in individual payments from CAP, an increase from &#163;2.8bn in 2016

Farmers in the East of England and Scotland received the highest individual subsidies, typically worth more than &#163;14,000 each

Scotland is the part of the UK that receives the largest amount of overall CAP funding, worth &#163;630m last year

Natural England, a government organisation, was the biggest recipient of an individual subsidy last year, receiving &#163;15m

In plans set out by the environment secretary Michael Gove last year, the UK government said it would guarantee current funding levels for farmers up until 2022.

Farmers and landowners would then receive payments for "public goods", such as maintaining access to the countryside and planting meadows.

A report published last month by the National Audit Office (NAO) said 42% of UK farmers would have made a loss between 2014 and 2017 without direct payments from the EU.

Keith Davis from the NAO said the government still had not told farmers exactly how the new system would operate after Brexit.

"We don't know what the government is going to pay for, and we don't know how much they'll pay.

"So at the moment farmers aren't in a position to be able to plan for the future" said Mr Davis.

A spokeswoman for the National Farmers Union (NFU) said: "Farmers and growers manage more than 70% of the UK landscape and play a fundamental role in providing safe, traceable and affordable food as well as environmental and economic benefits for the nation.

"We need clear and cast-iron commitments from this government on how they plan to back British food and farming."

A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "We've been clear that we will maintain the same funding for farmers until the end of this Parliament, expected in 2022.

"This will apply whether the UK leaves the EU with or without a deal.

"Our Agriculture Bill is our greatest opportunity to reset the agricultural sector for a new generation of farmers and land managers, breaking away from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. The Bill will be brought back to Parliament as soon as possible."</text><tags>Brexit, UK farming, European Union, Brexit</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49981981<category>technology</category><title>Twitter 'inadvertently' used email addresses for ads</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Twitter has said it could not say how many users had been affected

Twitter has apologised for "unintentionally" using email addresses and phone numbers, provided by users for account security, to enable targeted advertising.

The company said third-party marketers may have been able to reach specific users on Twitter based on contact details, even if the user had not wished the information be used this way.

In a statement, Twitter said it "cannot say with certainty how many people were impacted", but the BBC understands it affects users globally.

Unusually, the company is not proactively contacting customers directly to inform them of the breach.

The company would not say when it discovered the issue, but said it had addressed the problem &#8220;as of September 17&#8221; - 21 days ago.

The firm said it was "no longer using phone numbers or email addresses collected for safety or security purposes for advertising&#8221;.

Twitter, which has its European headquarters in Dublin, would not confirm whether or not it had notified the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, other than to say it was communicating with regulators &#8220;where appropriate&#8221;.

Under Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), users must be informed if data is used for a purpose other than what it was intended for.

Twitter says it has 139 million users that use the platform every day and are served with adverts.

Tailored advertising

The issue involves a system Twitter offers advertisers whereby they can match their own database of customer email addresses - gathered independently from Twitter - with users on Twitter that use the same email address.

The practice - common across social networks - allows for highly targeted advertising designed to reach users who are likely already familiar with the brand or product.

However, what Twitter revealed in its statement on Tuesday was that this email matching was referencing addresses that users had submitted solely for the purpose of enhancing their account security by adding two-factor authentication.

This is a method that adds a second level of security - such as getting a text message with a log-in code - to prevent malicious actors from being able to use a person&#8217;s credentials.

"When an advertiser uploaded their marketing list, we may have matched people on Twitter to their list based on the email or phone number the Twitter account holder provided for safety and security purposes,&#8221; the company explained.

"This was an error and we apologise.&#8221;

In March, Facebook was highly criticised for using numbers and email addresses submitted for two-factor authentication to target advertising. Unlike Twitter, however, Facebook did not consider the behaviour to be mistake.

But, in handing down its record-breaking $5bn fine, the US Federal Trade Commission said Facebook must stop using "the phone numbers it obtained specifically for security&#8221; to power its advertising platform.

A Spanish billionaire art collector has been sentenced to 18 months in jail and fined $58m (&#163;44m) for trying to smuggle a Picasso abroad to sell at auction.

The painter's work Head of a Young Woman, declared a national treasure, was seized from Jaime Bot&#237;n's yacht in Corsica, France, in 2015.

Bot&#237;n, 83, is the grandson of the founder of Santander bank and was its vice president until 2004.

He was forced to forfeit the work. He may appeal against his sentence.

However, he is unlikely to spend time behind bars as first-time offenders for non-violent crimes in Spain are often spared prison if they receive sentences of less than two years.

Prosecutors said Bot&#237;n planned to sell the Picasso at auction in London.

Any piece of art more than 100 years old and deemed culturally significant enough is registered as a national treasure, meaning owners must request permission before taking it outside of the country.

Bot&#237;n, who bought the painting in 1977 in London, had already been denied a permit.

He argued that he had the right to take it to Geneva for safekeeping, while his lawyers said that the state could not lay claim to the painting as it had only been in Spanish territory for six months since its purchase.

But Bot&#237;n was found guilty of "smuggling cultural goods" for removing the painting "from national territory without a permit".

The 1906 piece - worth an estimated &#8364;26m ($29m; &#163;22m) - is one of the few painted by Picasso during his Gosol period, a precursor to Cubism.

The artwork is now property of the state and has been given to the Reina Sofia art museum in Madrid.</text><tags>Art, Spain</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47543985<category>health</category><title>Cholesterol-lowering pill 'new option for statin users'</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images

A new type of drug - called bempedoic acid - could offer another weapon in the fight against bad cholesterol.

An international study suggests the pill lowers cholesterol in people who continue to have high levels despite taking other drugs such statins.

And scientists suggest the new therapy may also work as an alternative for people who are unable to take statins because of side-effects.

The research is published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Researchers say they have asked UK and US drug regulators to consider whether to approve the pill.

Why is cholesterol an issue?

Cardiovascular disease kills about 150,000 people in the UK each year.

Bad cholesterol is one of the main reasons - it leads to blood vessels furring up and becoming easy to block.

Blockages can be fatal - starving the heart or brain of oxygen and causing heart attacks and strokes.

Cutting saturated fat and having a healthy diet, along with regular exercise, can help lower bad cholesterol.

But this doesn't work for everyone.

And, for some, genetic conditions - rather than lifestyle - increase their levels.

Millions of people worldwide are prescribed drugs, most commonly statins, to reduce the amount of bad cholesterol in the blood.

But reported side-effects and how often these drugs are prescribed has attracted controversy.

What about the new pill?

The new drug works by blocking a key enzyme in the body, used to make cholesterol.

Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, of the British Heart Foundation charity, says: "On the whole, statins do a great job of lowering cholesterol. However, this new drug could provide real benefit for the few people who can't take them or require additional treatments to get it to the right level.

"The research suggests that it has the potential to reduce risk of heart attacks and strokes without major side-effects."

What does the study suggest?

The study involved more than 1,000 people who had cardiovascular disease or a genetic cholesterol condition and who were already on cholesterol lowering drugs (mainly statins).

They were given a pill of bempedoic acid every day for a year, on top of their usual medication.

About 700 others were instead given a placebo or dummy pill.

After three months, the group who had taken the new pill had cut their bad cholesterol by 17%, compared with the group given a dummy pill.

Prof Kausik Ray, from Imperial College London, says: "Bempedoic acid could be another addition to the arsenal of cholesterol lowering treatments available to patients.

"What we have is a new class of drug that could be given to patients who are already taking statins and could help them further reduce their cholesterol levels and thus potentially cut their risk of heart attacks and strokes."

Are there side-effects?

Every drug has side-effects, so it will be up to the patient and doctor to balance the individual benefits and risks.

Researchers say the rate of side-effects were similar between the group that took bempedoic acid and the group that didn't.

One side-effect that people on bempedoic acid experienced more was gout.

And more people stopped taking the new drug because of side-effects than people in the dummy pill group.

But unlike statins, researchers say, it works in the liver only and cannot reach the muscles.

So, some scientists predict, it will not have some of the side-effects that some people experience with statins.

But others are unsure and more research is needed to see if this is true and understand how many people the new pill could help.

Will it reduce heart attacks and strokes?

Studies so far, of which this latest one is the largest, suggest bempedoic acid can lower bad cholesterol - but we don't yet know how long for or whether this will definitely translate into fewer heart attacks and strokes.

Prof Jane Armitage, at the University of Oxford, described these latest results as promising.

Another, genetic, study, published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine, offers clues that the benefits of taking bempedoic acid - in terms of preventing heart disease and strokes - could be similar to that achieved by statins.

But Prof Armitage added: "Genetic studies cannot tell us whether the drug will be safe for a wide range of people."

A clearer picture of how safe and effective the drug is will emerge once a longer term trial looking at the number of heart attacks and strokes on the new drug is completed.

The US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, will examine this data once it is available, in a few years' time.</text><tags>Statins, Heart disease</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50865437<category>technology</category><title>Facial recognition fails on race, government study says</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Facial recognition tools are increasingly being used by police forces

A US government study suggests facial recognition algorithms are far less accurate at identifying African-American and Asian faces compared to Caucasian faces.

African-American females were even more likely to be misidentified, it indicated.

It throws fresh doubt on whether such technology should be used by law enforcement agencies.

One critic called the results "shocking".

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (Nist) tested 189 algorithms from 99 developers, including Intel, Microsoft, Toshiba, and Chinese firms Tencent and DiDi Chuxing.

One-to-one matching

Amazon - which sells its facial recognition product Rekognition to US police forces - did not submit one for review.

The retail giant had previously called a study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology "misleading". That report had suggested Rekognition performed badly when it came to recognising women with darker skin.

When matching a particular photo to another one of the same face - known as one-to-one matching - many of the algorithms tested falsely identified African-American and Asian faces between ten to 100 times more than Caucasian ones, according to the report.

And African-American females were more likely to be misidentified in so-called one-to-many matching, which compares a particular photo to many others in a database.

Congressman Bennie Thompson, chairman of the US House Committee on Homeland Security, told Reuters: "The administration must reassess its plans for facial recognition technology in light of these shocking results."

Computer scientist and founder of the Algorithmic Justice League Joy Buolamwini called the report "a comprehensive rebuttal" to those claiming bias in artificial intelligence software was not an issue.

Algorithms in the Nist study were tested on two types of error:

false positives, where software wrongly considers that photos of two different individuals show the same person

false negatives, where software fails to match two photos that show the same person

The software used photos from databases provided by the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, with no images from social media or video surveillance.

"While it is usually incorrect to make statements across algorithms, we found empirical evidence for the existence of demographic differentials in the majority of the face recognition algorithms we studied," said Patrick Grother, a Nist computer scientist and the report's primary author.

"While we do not explore what might cause these differentials, this data will be valuable to policymakers, developers and end users in thinking about the limitations and appropriate use of these algorithms."

One of the Chinese firms, SenseTime, whose algorithms were found to be inaccurate said it was the result of "bugs" which had now been addressed.

"The results are not reflective of our products, as they undergo thorough testing before entering the market. This is why our commercial solutions all report a high degree of accuracy," a spokesperson told the BBC.

Several US cities, including San Francisco and Oakland in California and Somerville, Massachusetts, have banned the use of facial recognition technology.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/50137781<category>sport</category><title>Dementia in football: Scottish team doctor urges temporary subs for concussion</title><text>Media playback is not supported on this device 'Suddenly there was a blackout' - Craigan recalls head knock

The co-author of research into dementia in football says he is "hopeful" the sport will bring in rugby-style temporary substitutions for concussion.

The proposal will be discussed by the International Football Association Board on Wednesday in Zurich.

Glasgow University research found ex- footballers were three and a half times more likely to die of dementia.

Dr John MacLean, Scottish FA chief medical consultant, also urged steps to reduce "heading load on young players".

MacLean is part of the Uefa medical committee which has put forward the temporary substitutions proposal.

Under current protocol, games are stopped for three minutes to allow assessment of suspected concussion by medical staff. If further treatment is required, the player has to leave the field.

MacLean is a "massive advocate" of head injury substitutions.

"That is going to the International Board and I would be hopeful in the relatively near future the laws of the game will be changed to include that," MacLean told BBC Scotland.

"That will allow hopefully a 10-minute period with a free substitution, as rugby does, that gives the medical staff the opportunity to assess that player in the quiet of the dressing room, without the manager or referee trying to hound the medical team off the pitch.

"Only 10% of concussions and head injuries involved loss of consciousness, so it's a relatively small percentage.

"Any player who has been knocked out should be removed from the game, no matter what age."

MacLean, who also serves as Scotland's national teams doctor, admits more research is required into the effects of heading the ball.

"Until we know the real place of heading, it would be wrong of us to say let's wait for another 10 years until this study is done," he added.

"Through work with the Scottish FA and Uefa, what we have started to do is put together some sensible guidelines. Some simple things like limiting heading training for young players, perhaps to one session per week to allow the brain to recover."</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-25966649<category>uk</category><title>Essex father tells of seven-year-old son's cancer fight</title><text>Image copyright John Whiteley Image caption John set up a blog during his son's illness to help "make sense" of it

Aged just four, Laughlin Whiteley was diagnosed with an aggressive and rare brain tumour.

The golf ball-sized growth was removed in an eight-hour operation and for the next 14 months his parents Andrea and John watched as he endured painful rounds of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

They hoped Laughlin, of Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, would make a full recovery but in November he was found to have another rare cancer.

Doctors believe Laughlin, known as Lockie, developed secondary acute myeloid leukaemia due to the strong chemotherapy drugs he had to take after his surgery.

His father John, a primary school teacher, and mother Andrea, an actress and drama teacher, have given up their jobs while Lockie, who is now seven, undergoes more treatment.

As Lockie's "guide and chronicler", his father started a blog to help him cope and answer Lockie's questions about his illness when he is older. Here he tells his son's story.

"We trimmed our hair again on the weekend, possibly for the last time for him, depending on how the radio and chemo affect it. It led to scar comparisons, which he [Lockie] won hands down as a 20-plus-year-old knee reconstruction does not really match a craniotomy."

"You wonder about the disparity between what we imagined for us, for our first little boy embarking on his educational journey, and the reality of what we are actually doing.

"Rather than school shoes, it is Crocs that can be slipped off once he has been magic-milked away to the land of nod. Rather than dressing for school, it is re-dressing in bed on the ward. Rather than schools bags, it is wiggly bags [to keep venous catheters clean and safe]. Rather than teachers, it is nurses. Rather than the head, it is the consultant. Possibly the only common thing is the packed lunch and the fact that much of it goes in the bin."

"The chemo must be doing its business as it is beginning to have serious side effects. There has been a significant deterioration in his vision in one eye... likely to be one of the drugs that damages nerves. Some, minor to date, hearing loss which is a side effect of one other drug.

"And there are other side effects, the ones they don't tell you about. In response to my comment, 'At least we don't have to hang around the hospital again tomorrow,' Lockie said, 'But it's not my fault!'.

"We avoid as much as humanly possible any talk that could make him feel any responsibility. But you can't shake the fact that he knows things have changed for him and for us."

6 June 2012

"Course 6/8 began yesterday, with a tailing off on some chemo, which gives mixed emotions. Lockie has been taken off Carboplatin, which has potential benefits in the short term like less sickness and less transfusions.

"But the reasons for stopping it have serious long-term implications as his hearing has continued to drop. This is irreversible, so last week's visit to the audiologist ended with him having putty squirted into each ear to make hearing aid moulds and choosing a Dalek and a Cyborg to be implanted in each."

31 August 2012

"Lockie's first words to me yesterday were: 'Today is my last treatment, yay,' accompanied by repeated fist pumps. He wanted a cake to celebrate so we embellished this with fizz and marshmallow biscuits to mark his bravery and accomplishments over the past 14 months.

"After 20 minutes of stunned incomprehension that everyone was there for him, he retired upstairs to his Lego with a select few, predominantly over 60 or under 11.

"Amid the sparkle and the joy, the hospital called. Two evenings have been spent back on Phoenix Ward for blood last night and IV antibiotics tonight due to a sizzling 39-plus degree temperature."

"There are rats in our shed and there are rats in Laughlin's marrow. Pest control is the same - more poison.

"He has developed a secondary cancer, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Our oncologist and haematologist said it was exceedingly rare, around one every five years.

"It is nasty and it is acute which means that it progresses quickly so needs shorter, intense treatment.

"The first course of treatment is a week or so of chemo and followed by 4-5 weeks in isolation. Once they are happy that the cancer has been wiped out as much as possible, he is then prepared for a bone marrow transplant. He would then be in isolation once more while the graft marrow gets established, for 1-6 months."

7 January 2014

"So we have hit a block. Laughlin's consultant told us the chemo has failed to make an impression.

"It is now a balancing act between what other chemo regimes might have an impact versus how sick they might make him. But he won't get to transplant at all without some reduction in the disease."

24 January 2014

"The BMT (bone marrow transplant) and haematology teams were unanimous in agreeing a suggested approach: light conditioning chemotherapy and an adult peripheral blood stem cell donor.

"Light-conditioning chemotherapy as the leukaemia has been resistant to chemotherapy to date and to reduce the risk of future toxic complications.

"Adult peripheral blood stem cell donor as this allows for high numbers of stem cells to be transplanted and to be induced to attack remaining leukaemic/host cells.

"In addition, there has been much activity about campaigning for further stem cell donors and support for children and families. We chose to name it Unlock a Life for Lockey.

"This is not just about him, but about the many other people who need stem cell donors, and a range of other supports in order to not be locked in by their diagnosis. His name obviously provides the dual themes of locks and keys."

A blood stem cell, or bone marrow, transplant can replace a damaged immune system in a person with blood cancer - if the donor's cell type matches

His family have set up an awareness campaign - Unlock a Life for Lockey - as their son has been so moved by the plight of other children without a matching donor.

In the past, bone marrow donation was carried out under general anaesthetic, but in many cases stem cells can now be harvested from the blood in a relatively painless procedure which is similar to giving blood.

Twitter has apologised for allowing adverts to be micro-targeted at certain users such as neo-Nazis, homophobes and other hate groups.

The BBC discovered the issue and that prompted the tech firm to act.

Our investigation found it possible to target users who had shown an interest in keywords including "transphobic", "white supremacists" and "anti-gay".

Twitter allows ads to be directed at users who have posted about or searched for specific topics.

But the firm has now said it is sorry for failing to exclude discriminatory terms.

Anti-hate charities had raised concerns that the US tech company's advertising platform could have been used to spread intolerance.

What exactly was the problem?

Like many social media companies, Twitter creates detailed profiles of its users by collecting data on the things they post, like, watch and share.

Advertisers can take advantage of this by using its tools to select their campaign audience from a list of characteristics, for example "parents of teenagers", or "amateur photographers".

They can also control who sees their message by using keywords.

Twitter gives the advertiser an estimate for how many users are likely to qualify as a result.

For example, a car website wanting to reach people using the term "petrolhead" would be told that the potential audience is between 140,000 and 172,000 people.

Twitter's keywords were supposed to be restricted.

But our tests showed that it was possible to advertise to people using the term "neo-Nazi".

The ad tool had indicated that in the UK, this would target a potential audience of 67,000 to 81,000 people.

Other more offensive terms were also an option.

How did the BBC test this?

We created a generic advert from an anonymous Twitter account, saying "Happy New Year".

We then targeted three different audiences based on sensitive keywords.

Twitter's website said that ads on its platform would be reviewed prior to being launched, and the BBC's ad initially went into a "pending" state.

But soon afterwards, it was approved and ran for a few hours until we stopped it.

In that time, 37 users saw the post and two of them clicked on a link attached, which directed them to a news article about memes. Running the ad cost &#163;3.84.

Targeting an advert using other problematic keywords seemed to be just as easy to do.

A campaign using the keywords "islamophobes", "islamaphobia", "islamophobic" and '#islamophobic' had a potential to reach 92,900 to 114,000 Twitter users, according to Twitter's tool.

Advertising to vulnerable groups was also possible.

We ran the same advert to an audience of 13 to 24-year-olds using the keywords "anorexic", "bulimic", "anorexia" and "bulimia".

Twitter estimated the target audience amounted to 20,000 people. The post was seen by 255 users, and 14 people clicked on the link before we stopped it.

What did campaigners say?

Hope Not Hate, an anti-extremism charity, said it feared that Twitter's ads could become a propaganda tool for the far-right.

"I can see this being used to promote engagement and deepen the conviction of individuals who have indicated some or partial agreement with intolerant causes or ideas," said Patrik Hermansson, its social media researcher.

The eating disorder charity Anorexia and Bulimia Care added that it believed the ad tool had already been abused.

"I've been talking about my eating disorder on social media for a few years now and been targeted many times with adverts based on dietary supplements, weight loss supplements, spinal corrective surgery," said Daniel Magson, the organisation's chairman.

"It's quite triggering for me, and I'm campaigning to get it stopped through Parliament. So, it's great news that Twitter has now acted."

What did Twitter say?

The social network said it had policies in place to avoid the abuse of keyword targeting, but acknowledged they had not been applied correctly.

"[Our] preventative measures include banning certain sensitive or discriminatory terms, which we update on a continuous basis," it said in a statement.

"In this instance, some of these terms were permitted for targeting purposes. This was an error.

"We're very sorry this happened and as soon as we were made aware of the issue, we rectified it.

"We continue to enforce our ads policies, including restricting the promotion of content in a wide range of areas, including inappropriate content targeting minors."</text><tags>Twitter, Advertising, Social media</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51114425<category>business</category><title>US and China sign deal to ease trade war</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Liu He and Donald Trump

The US and China have signed an agreement aimed at easing a trade war that has rattled markets and weighed on the global economy.

Speaking in Washington, US President Donald Trump said the pact would be "transformative" for the US economy.

Chinese leaders called it a "win-win" deal that would help foster better relations between the two countries.

China has pledged to boost US imports by $200bn above 2017 levels and strengthen intellectual property rules.

In exchange, the US has agreed to halve some of the new tariffs it has imposed on Chinese products.

However the majority of the border taxes remain in place, which has prompted business groups to call for further talks.

"There's a lot of work to do ahead," said Jeremie Waterman, president of the China Center at the US Chamber of Commerce. "Bottom line is, they should enjoy today but not wait too long to get back to the table for phase two."

The US and China have engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war since 2018, which has led to extra import taxes being levied on more than $450bn (&#163;350bn) worth of traded goods. The ongoing dispute has disrupted trade flows, dampened global economic growth and unnerved investors.

'Righting wrongs'

At a signing ceremony in Washington, Mr Trump said the deal sets the stage for a stronger relationship between the US and China. The event, which occurred as the Senate prepared to take up Mr Trump's impeachment, was attended by top Republican donors and business leaders.

"Together we are righting the wrongs of the past and delivering a future of economic justice and security," he said.

"Far beyond even this deal, it's going to lead to an even stronger world peace," he added.

What's in the deal?

China has committed to increasing its US imports by at least $200bn over 2017 levels, boosting purchases of agriculture by $32bn, manufacturing by $78bn, energy by $52bn and services by $38bn.

China has agreed to take more action against counterfeiting and make it easier for companies to pursue legal action over trade secret theft

The US will maintain up to 25% tariffs on an estimated $360bn worth of Chinese goods; China, which has levied new tariffs on $100bn worth of US products, is also expected to maintain the majority of them

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who signed the deal on behalf of China, said the agreement was rooted in "equality and mutual respect" and defended his country's economic model in his remarks.

"China has developed a political system and a model of economic development that suits its national reality," he said.

"This doesn't mean that China and the US cannot work together. On the contrary, our two countries share enormous common commercial interests."

"We hope both sides will abide by and keep the agreement in earnest."

It has been hailed by the White House as a breakthrough in a war that President Trump triggered to protect American jobs and companies from what he viewed as unfair competition from China.

The weapon of choice: billions of dollars of tariffs, or extra charges, on imports. But that has hurt the very workers and businesses they were meant to protect, in both countries.

For all the fanfare - and the unusual appearance of a president at the signing of a bilateral trade deal - this is more armistice than victory - with only a small proportion of the tariffs being reversed and relatively minor concessions granted by both sides. Tariffs remain on around two-thirds of the goods Americans buy from China

Moreover, Washington's fundamental complaints about Chinese practices - from its approach to subsidising businesses to cybertheft - remain unresolved. With President Trump's ambition to rewrite the rules of global trade yet to be achieved, some fear he may turn his firepower on Europe next - just as the UK is looking to broker an advantageous post-Brexit relationship

'Incremental progress'

Mr Trump has said the accord signed on Wednesday is a "phase one" agreement and promised that the administration will take up other issues - such as China's state subsidies - in future negotiations.

The US accuses China of "unfair" business practices, such as providing subsidies for domestic businesses and administrative rules that have made it difficult for US firms to operate in the country.

Mr Trump has defended maintaining the bulk of the tariffs, saying they will provide leverage in future talks. But US business groups and analysts expressed concern.

"While Phase One makes incremental progress, it remains to be seen whether it will deliver any meaningful relief for farmers like me," said Michelle Erickson-Jones, a Montana wheat farmer, who is affiliated with the lobby group Farmers for Free Trade. "The promises of lofty purchases are encouraging but farmers like me will believe it when we see it."

Charles Kane, a lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, said Mr Trump sees China as a useful political scapegoat, making any serious negotiation unlikely until after the November presidential election.

"He's using [the trade war] as a political weapon," Mr Kane said.</text><tags>Trump tariffs, China-US relations, Trade war, Donald Trump</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51100109<category>world</category><title>'Miracle baby' born after womb transplant</title><text>Nine Months in the Bronx - 'Don't take my baby'

The FBI has arrested three suspected members of a neo-Nazi hate group who planned to travel to a pro-gun rally in Virginia on Monday.

One was a Canadian army reservist who was fired in August over ties to hate groups and has been suspected missing since, Canadian police told the BBC.

Virginia governor Ralph Northam has declared a state of emergency in the city of Richmond ahead of the rally.

He said law enforcement believed there was a threat of violence.

Governor Northam on Thursday announced a ban guns in the state's Capitol area in Richmond from Friday until Tuesday, citing threats of violence made ahead of the rally. The order also covers other weapons such as knives and sticks.

He said some of the violent rhetoric seen online was reminiscent of that seen before the deadly Charlottesville rally in 2017, at which a 32-year-old counter protester, Heather Heyer, was killed by white nationalist James Fields.

Who are the accused?

FBI in Baltimore, Maryland charged Brian Lemley, 33, and William Bilbrough, 19, with transporting and harbouring aliens. They charged Mr Lemley and Canadian Patrik Mathews with transporting a firearm and ammunition with intent to commit a felony.

The FBI alleges that Mr Mathews entered the US illegally at the Manitoba/Minnesota border. All three are accused of being members of a white supremacist group known as The Base.

According to the criminal complaint filed with the state's attorney general, The Base's members discussed in encrypted online chatrooms "recruitment, creating a white ethno-state, committing acts of violence against minority communities (including African-Americans and Jewish-Americans), the organization's military-style training camps, and ways to make improvised explosive devices".

Rally for gun rights

Monday's rally was planned by the Virginia Citizens Defence League (VCDL), a pro-gun-rights group, to protest gun control legislation that is expected to pass in the new year. VCDL said it was expecting 50,000 people to attend the protest.

Skip Twitter post by @GovernorVA We have received credible intelligence from our law enforcement agencies of threats of violence surrounding the demonstration planned for Monday, January 20. This includes extremist rhetoric similar to what has been seen before major incidents, such as Charlottesville in 2017. &#8212; Ralph Northam (@GovernorVA) January 15, 2020 Report

Democrats won control of the Virginia state legislature last autumn, for the first time since 1994, and have made gun control a key part of their platform, especially in light of last summer's shooting at Virginia Beach, which killed 12.

Mr Northam, who is also a Democrat and has been governor since 2017, tried to get gun control measures passed to no avail this summer, before the election.

On the run

Mr Mathews was a combat engineer in the Canadian Army Reserve, but he was fired in late August after an nundercover reporter for the Winnipeg Free Press connected him to The Base and alleged he was trying to recruit new members.

"We're real (expletive) Nazis and they can't do s&#8212;- to us but wait for us to put em against the wall," Mr Mathews allegedly wrote in an online encrypted chatroom.

Police raided Mr Matthews' home shortly after the report and seized a number of firearms.

He subsequently disappeared, and RCMP were still looking for him on 2 September, when they found his car abandoned about five miles (8 km) away from the Minnesota border.</text><tags>United States, Neo-Nazism, Virginia</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/51129714<category>sport</category><title>Marcus Rashford: Manchester United striker a doubt for Liverpool match after back injury</title><text>Marcus Rashford came on as a 64th-minute substitute for Daniel James, but then went off in the 80th minute, with Jesse Lingard coming on

Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said his decision to play Marcus Rashford "backfired" after the striker went off with a back injury.

Rashford, 22, was replaced in the 80th minute after he had been on the pitch for 16 minutes as United beat Wolves 1-0 in their FA Cup third-round replay.

The England international has scored 22 goals for club and country this season.

Solskjaer, whose side play away at Premier League leaders Liverpool on Sunday, said Rashford "couldn't run".

"He'll be tested in the next few days - we have to see for Sunday," added the Norwegian.

"I didn't want to play him. I think he got a knock, a knee or something, in his back, but he's been struggling for a little while.

"That's why we've kept him away [from starting against Wolves], but we needed the win."

Asked if the decision to play Rashford backfired, Solskjaer replied: "He was involved in the goal, so that was a positive, but it backfired.

"He's a quick healer and he'll play through some pain, definitely, if he's capable and it's not a bad, bad injury, but we've seen that he's struggled lately.

"But that's been more when he's been tired. He wasn't on long enough to be tired so it might be something that just happened there and then.

"He's been absolutely top this season so we'll do anything and everything we can to get him fit for Sunday. If he's not, then we'll play without him."

Rashford has featured in 13 matches - starting 11 of them - since the beginning of December, scoring nine goals in that period.

United will now play either Watford or League One side Tranmere away from home in the fourth round of the FA Cup on 26 January.

Solskjaer's side are also fifth in the Premier League, in the last 32 of the Europa League and trail Manchester City 3-1 after the opening leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final.

'He's been like a one-man team'

Former Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher suggested an injury to Rashford would be a concern because of how vital he is to the team.

"The fact he has played 200 games already at such a young age, he is so important," Fletcher said on BBC Radio 5 live.

"They are largely becoming reliant on him. Marcus Rashford carries a load in terms of driving team up the pitch, getting shots getting goals, getting assists.

"He has almost been like a one-man team."

The Times chief football writer Henry Winter says clubs need to be careful "not to flog" the players too much by playing them in too many games.

"It is interesting listening to ex-professionals saying he is not quite running as freely as they would expect and is holding something back," Winter said.

"I understand why Manchester United have to play him and I understand his mentality; he loves this club, plays for the shirt.

"He is is Manchester United's most important player but at some stage we have to take a step back and say: Let's not flog these players too much.

"It is not an England thing, this is about making sure he is ready for Manchester United over the next few years and not burning him out too often."</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51131294<category>world</category><title>Kashmir avalanche: Girl rescued after 18 hours buried in snow</title><text>Image copyright Reuters Image caption Neelum Valley, where Samina was found, was the worst hit by avalanches

A 12-year-old girl has been found alive after being buried under snow for 18 hours when an avalanche hit her home in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

Samina Bibi said she had been "screaming and shouting for help" as she lay trapped in a room under the snow, she told Reuters.

She said she thought she would "die there", before she was rescued.

The Neelum Valley has been hit by avalanches and landslides in recent days killing at least 74 people.

While the Himalayan region is prone to weather disasters, the current death toll is one the highest in recent history.

India-administered Kashmir and Afghanistan have also been affected. But Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Neelum Valley in particular, were the worst hit. Rescuers there are still searching for missing people.

'It happened in the blink of an eye'

Samina was rescued from Bakwali village and taken to a hospital in Muzaffarabad. However several members of her family were killed.

Her mother, Shahnaz Bibi, said the family had been huddled around a fire in their three-storey house when the avalanche hit.

"We didn't hear a rumble. It happened in the blink of an eye," she said, telling Reuters she had given up hope of finding her daughter alive.

Samina said she suffered from a leg fracture and that blood had been oozing from her mouth. She said she could not sleep while she waited to be rescued.

Across Pakistan, at least 100 people have died in snow-hit areas, said the country's National Disaster Management Authority.

Eight people have also died in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, according to local media.

Kashmir covers around 86,000 sq miles (138 sq km), and is famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains.

But it has been locked in a decades-long crisis, and has been divided between India and Pakistan since both countries gained their independence in 1947.</text><tags>Afghanistan, Kashmir, India, Severe weather, Pakistan</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49044072<category>uk</category><title>Five ways UK farmers are tackling climate change</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images

Farmers are on the front line of climate change - vulnerable to changes in temperature and rainfall, as well as increasingly frequent extreme weather events.

They also face criticism, in particular over greenhouse gas emissions from the meat and dairy industry, with calls for a move to a more plant-based diet.

Agriculture is currently responsible for about 9% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from methane.

The National Farmers' Union (NFU), which represents 55,000 UK farmers, has set a target of net-zero emissions in British farming by 2040.

That is not enough for some environmentalists, who say a comprehensive overhaul of farming practices and a move to less intensive production is long overdue.

But some new and surprising changes are happening on the UK's farms.

1. Sending in robots

Scientists in Wiltshire are part of a growing group of experts around the world developing small battery-powered robots that could drastically cut tractor use.

Tractors use diesel, a major source of carbon emissions in farming.

"Using robots cuts the energy used in cultivation by about 90%," says Sarra Mander of the Salisbury-based Small Robot Company.

The machines rely on artificial intelligence to sow seeds, identify individual weeds, and apply exactly the right amounts of pesticide and fertiliser in the right places, rather than spraying it across a whole field.

"If you had a few weeds in your garden, you wouldn't spray the whole garden, you'd just spray the area with the problem. That's what we do. It's all about precision," adds Sarra.

Sowing is done by placing individual seeds in the ground, without ploughing. Less soil disturbance means more carbon stays locked in the soil.

Robots are still relatively unusual in UK arable farming but machines are being developed all over the world to handle everything from mapping to planting, pruning and picking.

The investment bank Goldman Sachs is among those predicting a huge global shift to technology-driven "precision farming" in the coming years.

2. Using drones to map fields

Drones and tractor-mounted sensors are also being used to help farmers work out the exact patterns of moisture, weeds and pests.

The data is fed to precision machinery to target areas that need work - and leave the rest undisturbed.

Nitrogen fertiliser takes a lot of energy to produce and, particularly if it is applied at the wrong time and in the wrong quantities, bacteria act on it to make nitrous oxide.

Nitrous oxide is 200 to 300 times more effective in trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.

Mapping and analysing each field enables farmers to target nitrogen fertiliser in only those places where it is needed, at the right time - and cut their emissions.

"This kind of innovation is fantastic for us," says Becky Willson, of the Farm Carbon Cutting Toolkit organisation. "It's not a total answer but it can really help."

3. Planting more trees

Like Becky, many environmental campaigners also believe applying new technology without fundamental change to intensive farming practices is not enough.

Nick Rau, of Friends of the Earth, says: "New technology is helpful - but simple, low-tech solutions, looking at whole farms over a number of seasons have been grossly neglected."

Nick believes there's huge potential in a range of solutions and points, in particular, to tree planting.

Friends of the Earth is calling for a doubling of tree cover - to boost carbon storage, help with flooding and prevent soil erosion.

Cambridgeshire farmer Stephen Briggs agrees. "It's about taking lessons from nature," he says.

He now grows 13 different varieties of apples over 125 acres (0.5 sq km), about 8% of his farm.

The apple trees stop soil erosion, lock carbon into the ground, support biodiversity and deliver a new crop.

His profitability, Stephen says, has improved since he made the change, 10 years ago.

"By growing trees alongside wheat, you expand the productive space up into the air and down into the soil, plus you extend the period of the year that you're capturing the sunshine," he says.

Wind protection from trees can also reduce the time livestock need to be kept indoors in the winter, again saving on energy and cutting emissions.

4. Keeping livestock outside for longer

Farmers who keep their animals outdoors for longer in the UK can help to cut emissions thousands of miles away.

When animals are taken indoors, they are sometimes fed on soya imported from Latin America.

Soya is often cultivated on land that was previously rainforest, so the demand for animal feed in the UK is, critics say, exporting deforestation.

British cows are fed on grass for more of the year than cows in many other countries, so the UK's impact on deforestation through soy imports may be relatively small.

But soya production for the global animal feed industry is one of the most important drivers of deforestation, according to the Global Forest Atlas, and the Amazon has been cleared at an alarming rate.

It's estimated that since 1970 about 20% of the Amazon has been lost.

The environmental group Greenpeace has also highlighted the huge areas of rainforest lost to soya cultivation.

And Richard Finlay, of the NFU, says British farmers understand their part in fighting climate change does not end at UK shores.

"A large proportion of the supply chain has already committed to solely using sustainable, responsibly sourced soya," he says.

5. Cutting methane emissions

Cows and sheep produce methane in their digestive systems.

Methane produces 21 times as much warming in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.

Whilst carbon dioxide is the biggest concern for many other industries, in farming methane is a major worry.

The NFU points to many farmers using methane from manures and slurries to generate electricity and says the British livestock industry is one of the most efficient and sustainable in the world.

But the methane problem has generated a whole range of other approaches.

"There's a lot of thinking about feed additives which might reduce methane production in the animals' guts," Becky Willson says.

Some researchers and organisations, such as Becky's, are also pointing to better breeding and genetics as a way forward.

For beef cattle, one approach in Scotland has been to select animals for breeding on the basis of how much methane they produce in their digestive systems.

For dairy cattle, which start producing milk at the age of two, an approach in the US has been aimed at lengthening the animals' productive lifespan - so the proportion of the animals' life that is unproductive and spent consuming energy and emitting methane is reduced.

Put simply, breeding cows which produce milk for longer, reduces the need for dairy calf replacements - which will consume energy and emit methane, without producing milk, for the first two years of their lives.

For lambs, with a typical lifespan of about six to eight months, the goal has been to produce animals that fatten more quickly and can be slaughtered earlier.

Research in Wales pointed to reductions of about six days in the time taken to fatten hill lambs, though some farmers report reductions of up to 30 days.

It is, quite literally, a matter of life and death.

Hull KR forward Mose Masoe's serious spinal injury is "career-ending", head coach Tony Smith has confirmed.

Masoe, 30, was hurt in Sunday's friendly against Wakefield and had to have emergency surgery.

Owner Neil Hudgell said on Wednesday that there "won't be anything definitive for a long time" on Masoe's long-term condition.

"If Mose is able to walk again that will be a success," Smith told BBC Radio Humberside.

"If you ask his consultant he would not be able to tell you exactly what he will get back to.

"I know Mose is just looking forward to hugging his children again."

A fundraising page set up by the club has received more than &#163;13,000 in four days, money which will go towards Masoe's rehabilitation and care, as well as travel and accommodation needs for his family.

Meanwhile, the Robins have confirmed that the Samoa international has been appointed co-captain of the club for the 2020 season.

"Mose will play a role for us wherever he can, he will have some input and motivation into the team," Smith said.

"He has already done that after he sent a video message. I do want everyone to understand it was agreed last week, that that was going to be the case and it hasn't been a reaction to recent occurrences.

A man in his 40s has died after being hit by a car on one of the main routes into Swansea.

Emergency services were called to the A483 Fabian Way near Swansea just after 07:30 GMT on Thursday.

Police said the pedestrian had been near the "Amazon" roundabout when there was a collision with a white Mini Countryman vehicle.

The road was closed between junction 42 of the M4 and the Jersey Marine roundabout for about five hours.

It led to widespread delays, with motorists told to avoid the area.

South Wales Police has appealed for any witnesses to the incident to come forward, especially any who may have dash-cam footage of what happened.

An airline has apologised after it forced a passenger to take a pregnancy test in order to fly from Hong Kong to a US territory in the Pacific.

Midori Nishida, 25, was flying on a Hong Kong Express Airways plane in November to the island of Saipan, part of the Northern Mariana Islands.

They have become popular for foreign women to give birth as it gives US citizenship eligibility.

The airline was trying to "ensure US immigration laws were not undermined".

It initially said the test was part of a "fit-to-fly" assessment. However, it has now apologised "unreservedly" for the incident.

In 2018, more tourists than residents gave birth in the Northern Mariana Islands, according to the territory's data. This is thought to be heavily due to foreign women - including many from China - travelling to the territory to give birth.

What happened in November?

Ms Nishida, who now lives in Tokyo but grew up on Saipan, had filled in a questionnaire before the flight indicating she was not pregnant.

Despite this, airline staff demanded she undergo an assessment which included a pregnancy test. She was then escorted to a toilet and given a strip to urinate on.

When the test came back negative, she was allowed to board the plane to see her family, who have lived on the island for more than two decades.

Ms Nishida called the ordeal "very humiliating and frustrating" and said the airline did not respond to her initial complaints.

What is the airline saying now?

"We would like to apologise unreservedly to anyone who has been affected by this," Hong Kong Express Airways said in a statement to NBC News.

"We took actions on flights to Saipan from February 2019 to help ensure US immigration laws were not being undermined," stated the airline, which says it was acting on concerns raised by officials in the Northern Mariana Islands.

"We have immediately suspended the practice while we review it."

The Boston Red Sox have sacked manager Alex Cora as a result of his role in the "sign-stealing" scandal during his time as Houston Astros bench coach.

Cora, 44, managed the Red Sox to a World Series victory in 2018.

But a Major League Baseball (MLB) investigation into the Astros found he played a key role in the use of a camera to steal signs being given by catchers to pitchers in 2017.

A separate MLB investigation into the Red Sox is yet to conclude.

"This is a sad day for us," the Red Sox said in a statement. "Given the findings and the commissioner's ruling, we collectively decided that it would not be possible for Alex to effectively lead the club going forward and we mutually agreed to part ways."

MLB suspended Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager AJ Hinch for a year without pay for their role in the scandal, and the pair were subsequently fired by team owner Jim Crane.

The Astros were also fined $5m (&#163;3.8m), and made to surrender draft picks.

While Cora was mentioned 11 times in the nine-page report, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said he would defer any disciplinary action on the Boston manager until the ongoing investigation into the Red Sox - over the alleged use of their video replay room to steal signs during their 2018 title-winning season - was completed.

Cora, whose playing career included four seasons with the Red Sox, had been Hinch's number two during 2017, when the Astros won the World Series - before returning to Fenway as manager, where he won baseball's biggest prize again a year later.

He said: "I do not want to be a distraction to the Red Sox as they move forward.

"My two years as manager were the best years of my life. It was an honour to manage these teams and help bring a World Series championship back to Boston. This is a special place. There is nothing like it in all of baseball, and I will miss it dearly."

What is 'sign stealing'?

It happens when teams monitor what finger signs a catcher is using to request specific deliveries - such as a fastball, curveball or slider - from his pitcher.

MLB rules prohibit the use of electronic equipment to steal signs but otherwise the practice, while frowned upon, is not against the rules.

A report in The Athletic claimed the Astros would monitor catchers' signals via a camera in the outfield, before banging on a rubbish bin inside the clubhouse to signal to the batter that an off-speed pitch was expected.

A subsequent story, also in The Athletic, alleged that Boston players had visited their video replay room, before relaying information to team-mates on the field.

Back in September 2017, the Red Sox were fined by MLB for using an Apple Watch to steal signs from the New York Yankees.

After that incident, MLB issued a specific warning to all 30 teams over technology.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/51123148<category>sport</category><title>Australia fires: How poor air quality affects tennis players</title><text>Maria Sharapova's exhibition match on Tuesday was ended early because of the air quality

2020 Australian Open Venue: Melbourne Park Dates: 20 January to 2 February Coverage: Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra and online; Live text on selected matches on the BBC Sport website and app.

Coughing fits, retirements and player anger - this week's Australian Open qualifying has been repeatedly affected by the country's ongoing bushfire crisis.

So how does the "very poor" air quality affect elite athletes?

Professor of sport and exercise science John Brewer explains.

The quick science bit

When we exercise and we take air into our lungs, there are minute sacks in our lungs called alveoli. They extract oxygen from that air and take that into the blood stream and then into the muscles to help provide the body with the energy it needs.

If that air going into their lungs is contaminated with other particles from the bush fires, then that can really impact on the ability of the sacks to transport the all-important oxygen into the blood stream.

For tennis players, that can cause extra fatigue, perhaps the loss of concentration, plus headaches and nausea, as well as slow their recovery rate afterwards.

The numbers

At rest, most people will breathe in, and out, around 10 litres of air per minute.

Just under 21% of this consists of oxygen.

During exercise this demand for energy, oxygen and air increases significantly, and in a sport such as tennis where players need to perform repeated bursts of high-intensity activity, the amount of air going into and out of the lungs can often approach 100 litres per minute, a 10-fold increase.

What about players with asthma?

For players who have pre-existing conditions such as asthma, the irritation caused by the particulates in the air could trigger a reaction that narrows the airways, and makes breathing and oxygen uptake even harder.

In some cases this could prevent them from playing altogether, causing significant respiratory distress, which if untreated could pose a risk to the player.

Don't forget the heat

High levels of heat and humidity are a routine challenge for players at the Australian Open, and will result in higher heart rates and breathing frequency as players cope with the physiological demands of keeping cool and preventing their body temperature from rising too high.

In those conditions, the heart has to work much harder to pump blood to the skin so that body heat can be lost, and this extra load on the heart will be even greater when air in the lungs is of a poor quality.

Players will find themselves fatiguing rapidly as they cope with a lack of oxygen in the blood, and the high heart rates they will experience as the body combats the effects of heat and dehydration.

Any longer-term impact?

The poor air quality and smoke particles will affect spectators as well as players, and some of the air quality levels that have been recorded equate to smoking large numbers of cigarettes a day.

As well as restricting breathing and oxygen transport capacity, prolonged exposure to smoke-polluted air is almost certainly going to impact on the health of the general population, with the potential for harmful chemicals and particulates to enter the lungs and cause long-term damage.

Spectators who are concerned should be advised to wear face masks that will help filter the harmful particulates from the air that they breathe in.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-50073546<category>uk</category><title>Cars could be banned from Birmingham road tunnels</title><text>Image copyright Google Image caption Questions were raised at the transport and sustainability scrutiny committee over the future of the A38 tunnels

Cars could be banned from Birmingham's city centre road tunnels, as one of several ideas being considered by transport bosses.

Details of the city's Transport Plan have emerged at a committee meeting, ahead of its publication next month.

But the ideas, part of a "medium to longer term" vision, would require about &#163;1bn of investment in public transport, the council believes.

The proposals have prompted mixed reaction from councillors.

Birmingham City Council has already been given a final warning to clean up its air by 2020 and has approved plans for a clean air zone which has been delayed by government.

The Local Democracy Reporting Service said Mel Jones, Birmingham City Council's head of transport planning and network strategy, told its transport and sustainability scrutiny committee transforming the city centre was one of the plan's four "big moves".

She said the city centre could be divided into a series of cells, which cars could only access from the ring road and not travel through the centre.

Phil Edwards, assistant director for transport and connectivity, said rather than "brick up" the Queensway and other tunnels, he suggested they could be used by trams, buses and even cyclists.

He added that the ideas outlined in the Transport Plan were more than "a year or two around the corner".

The ideas have already prompted criticism, including from the city's opposition Conservative group leader, Councillor Rob Alden, who accused the Labour-run council of conducting an "ongoing war on motorists".

A 100-year-old bookshop has been inundated with orders after tweeting it had a "tumbleweed" day in which it had not sold a single book.

An employee at Petersfield Bookshop posted a picture of the store on Tuesday and said it might have been the first time it had not made a sale.

The tweet was retweeted more than 7,000 times, including by author Neil Gaiman.

The shop's managing director John Westwood said he had been "overwhelmed" by the response.

"I believe in this industry, but online ordering and Amazon has hit us hard. I've had to sell my flat to keep the store afloat and most evenings sleep on a camp bed in the shop.

"We have lots of big plans for the future, on how to expand and grow, we just need to get there first."

Mr Westwood, who is well known locally as a fanatical Portsmouth FC fan, said since the tweet he had received more than 300 messages inquiring after books and 95 orders.

"It has been overwhelming, mind-blowing and very humbling. Book-lovers are a very special people, and everyone has been so supportive.

"I've carried on this store for my father - if you want to be rich you don't go into the book industry. Books are special things and nothing beats going into a bookstore.

"Seeing them, touching them, smelling them - it is a special place."

He thanked Gaiman, writer of The Sandman, Coraline, and Good Omens for the "orders we received as a result of the Gaiman bump".

The US has warned the British government it "would be madness" to use Huawei technology in the UK's 5G network.

A US delegation presented the UK with new evidence claiming to show security risks posed by using the Chinese firm.

US President Donald Trump has sought to pressure Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the issue.

A decision is expected this month on whether to allow Huawei to supply some "non-core" parts for the UK network.

A US delegation led by deputy National Security Adviser Matt Pottinger met ministers in London on Monday.

Senior US officials handed over a dossier of technical information which sources claim challenged British intelligence's own technical assessment that it would be possible to use Huawei in the 5G infrastructure without risks to national security.

US sources refused to comment on the content of the file.

The move is being seen as the latest round in an intense lobbying effort by the Trump administration as the UK government prepares to makes its decision on the 5G network.

Last year, the US banned companies from selling components and technology to Huawei and 68 related companies, citing national security concerns.

The US has previously warned that any use of Huawei would lead to a review of intelligence sharing.

However, UK officials have suggested they are not worried that such a review would lead to any substantive change in behaviour.

The head of MI5, Andrew Parker, told the Financial Times he has "no reason to think" the UK's intelligence-sharing relationship with the US would be adversely affected if Britain used Huawei technology.

A Huawei spokesperson said: "We are a private company which has supplied 3G, 4G and broadband equipment to the UK's telecoms companies for 15 years. British experts are clear our technology does not pose a security risk."

Meanwhile, Conservative MP Bob Seely has said Huawei "to all intents and purposes is part of the Chinese state" and a deal with the tech giant would allow Beijing to access the UK's network.

He called on Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee to open an immediate investigation into the company's suitability to build parts of the UK's 5G infrastructure.

A government spokesperson said: "The security and resilience of the UK's telecoms networks is of paramount importance."

"The government continues to consider its position on high risk vendors and a decision will be made in due course."</text><tags>5G, Huawei</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/51107343<category>sport</category><title>Hakan Sukur: How former Turkey star ended up in the US as a taxi driver</title><text>Sukur scored 51 goals in 112 appearances for Turkey

Hakan Sukur is Turkey's greatest ever goalscorer and once one of Europe's most prolific strikers. A legend.

So, how did he end up driving taxis and selling books for a living in the US, in exile from his home country?

According to an interview with German newspaper, Welt am Sonntag, the 48-year-old former striker's life has taken an unusual and troubling turn since retiring from football in 2008.

He claims that a rift with the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has exposed him to death threats, false accusations and lack of access to funds.

'I have nothing left, Erdogan took everything: my right to liberty, freedom of expression and right to work," he told the paper.

Sukur scored 51 goals in 112 appearances for Turkey between 1992 and 2007. He was part of the Turkish side that finished third at the 2002 World Cup.

The former Blackburn player spent the majority of his career at Galatasaray and is the all-time leading goalscorer in the Super Lig - the Turkish top flight.

Sukur scored what is still the fastest ever World Cup goal, just 11 seconds after kick-off against South Korea in 2002

After retiring from football, he went into politics. In 2011, Sukur won a seat in Turkey's Parliament as a member of Erdogan's Justice and Development Party .

But he was also tied to Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Islamic scholar and rival of Erdogan, whom the Turkish President blamed for a bloody attempted coup in 2016.

Sukur, by then living in the US, reportedly denounced the attempted coup, but was nonetheless, in 2017, described by Turkish-run state media as a "fugitive member of the Fetullah Terrorist Organisation (FETO)".

That report describes him living in a $3m house, running a cafe at Palo Alto, "the richest area of San Francisco Bay Area".

Sukur tells a less fun-sounding story.

"I moved to the United States, initially running a cafe in California, but strange people kept coming into the bar," he told Welt am Sonntag. "Now I drive for Uber and I sell books."

He has said that his houses, businesses and bank accounts in Turkey had all been seized by Erdogan's government.

He also denies any crimes.

"Nobody seems able to explain what my role in this coup was supposed to be," he added. "I never did anything illegal, I am not a traitor or a terrorist."

This is not the first time he's spoken on the subject. In 2018 he told the New York Times: "It's my country; I love my people, even though their ideas about me are distorted by controlled media."

The story throws up more questions about Erdogan's government. In 2018, Mesut Ozil attracted criticism after posing for a picture with the Turkish President, including from the German Football Federation (DFB), which said "football and the DFB defend values which are not sufficiently respected by Mr Erdogan".

Erdogan was subsequently best man at Ozil's wedding.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51136295<category>business</category><title>The challenges of developing 5G networks in Africa</title><text>Diet changes mean 'happier and healthier lives'

Turkey is restoring access to Wikipedia after a ban that lasted almost three years.

The country's Constitutional Court ruled that the ban violated freedom of expression, the pro-government newspaper Milliyet reported.

The online encyclopaedia was blocked in Turkey in April 2017, after it refused to delete articles critical of the country's government.

The ban lasted 991 days, said internet-monitoring organisation NetBlocks.org.

The Wikimedia Foundation, which runs the service, had refused to remove articles that said Turkey's government had cooperated with the so-called Islamic State (IS) group and al-Qaeda in Syria.

"We are thrilled that the people of Turkey will once again be able to participate in the largest global conversation about the culture and history of Turkey online and continue to make Wikipedia a vibrant source of information about Turkey and the world," the foundation blogged.

On Wednesday, the hashtag #Wikipedia became the top trending topic on Twitter in Turkey after the ban was lifted, BBC Monitoring reported.

Local newspaper Hurriyet said: "Wikipedia is finally free."

Not everyone in Turkey can browse Wikipedia at this point. The service has said that the ban is being lifted "gradually" and that some internet service providers are "still in the process of restoring access".

The community-edited encyclopaedia has been intermittently censored by authorities around the world, and remains blocked in China.

The general reaction in the Turkish media is a sense of relief, as the block was lifted almost a month after the Constitutional Court ruled the ban was a violation of freedom of expression.

Others said the decision to restore access to Wikipedia should have happened earlier.

"The Constitutional Court should not have waited 2.5 years. This has been a very serious loss for Turkey," Turkish academic Yaman Akdeniz, one of the plaintiffs against the ban, told Haberturk TV news channel.

Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales told the same channel that he "hoped this was a great victory for returning to a process of normalisation for freedom of speech" in Turkey.

Abdulkadir Selvi, a prominent pro-government columnist for the Hurriyet newspaper, wrote on Thursday that "he was mostly happy for [Turkish] ministers and bureaucrats who would enter Wikipedia through alternative means".

Turkish computer engineering expert Cem Say said he had removed Turkey from an entry about countries where Wikipedia is blocked.

"What a relief, Wikipedia!" prominent Turkish columnist and TV host Ahmet Hakan wrote in December, when media reported on the ruling.

"The lock on the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia was unsuitable," he said.

"The only thing I do not understand is this: why would anyone be bothered by Wikipedia being free?" he added at the time.</text><tags>Turkey, Censorship</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51142209<category>world</category><title>Canada: 'Iran must assume full responsibility' for downed plane</title><text>Video

Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Francois-Philippe Champagne has called on Iran to take full responsibility after it shot down a passenger plane last week.

He said he was speaking on behalf of the 176 victims from five countries, whose foreign ministers met in London on Thursday.

Canada, Britain, Ukraine, Sweden and Afghanistan have formed a new group to co-ordinate their response as the Iranian-led investigation unfolds.

Iran has said the plane was brought down by a missile fired in error.

The Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800, travelling to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and carrying many passengers on their way to Canada, was downed amid escalating tensions between Iran and the US. There were no survivors.

Hours before, Iranian missiles had targeted two airbases in Iraq housing US forces.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50744333<category>technology</category><title>Internet provider faces big GDPR fine for lax call centre checks</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The fine will serve as a warning to other call centre operators, say experts

A German internet service provider faces a &#8364;9.6m ($10.6m; &#163;8m) fine after being accused of failing to carry out tough enough customer ID checks.

Germany's data protection watchdog said anyone who called 1&amp;1 Telecom could get extensive personal information about someone else solely by giving their name and date of birth.

Fraudsters can easily collect such details from social networks and elsewhere on the net.

But the firm is challenging the ruling.

It said it did not accept the decision and intended to sue the authority.

The sum represents one of the largest penalties imposed under the EU's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).

1&amp;1 Telecom said the fine was "absolutely disproportionate" because the regulator had based its calculations on the wider company's sales.

On that basis "even the smallest discrepancy can result in huge fines", its data security officer Julia Zirfas complained.

The company also noted that it was in the process of rolling out new security protocols that will involve customers having to provide a Pin code when they call in.

'Wake-up call'

GDPR came into force in May 2018 giving data protection authorities the power to impose bigger penalties than before.

In the most serious cases, organisations can be fined up to &#8364;20m or 4% of their worldwide annual revenue - whichever is larger.

But regulators are supposed to take into account whether the offending body co-operated with their inquiry, any past offences and whether the infringement was deliberate or a mistake, among other factors, when deciding the amount.

In this case, the BfDI (Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information) acknowledged that 1&amp;1 Telecom had been "transparent and very co-operative" and had also taken steps to improve its practices.

But the watchdog said the sum was still justified on the basis that its entire customer base had been put at risk.

In October, the same regulator punished a German property company with a bigger &#8364;14.5m fine for holding on to people's personal data for longer than was necessary.

And other European counterparts have told Google, British Airways and Marriott Hotels to pay even larger sums for other GDPR-related offences.

But one data privacy expert said the latest ruling was still significant.

"It's only the second time there's been a multi-million euro penalty for a straightforward security issue, following a Bulgarian case," Tim Turner, director of 2040 Training told the BBC.

"Call centres have to balance easy access for customers with sensible verification measures, and this will be a wake-up call for all organisations trying to work out how much security to face callers with."</text><tags>Privacy, GDPR</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-40109396<category>uk</category><title>JRR Tolkien book Beren and L&#250;thien published after 100 years</title><text>Image caption JRR Tolkien had the idea for Beren and L&#250;thien after returning from the Somme

A new book by Lord of the Rings author JRR Tolkien is going on sale - 100 years after it was first conceived.

Beren and L&#250;thien has been described as a "very personal story" that the Oxford professor thought up after returning from the Battle of the Somme.

It was edited by his son Christopher Tolkien and contains versions of a tale that became part of The Silmarillion.

The book features illustrations by Alan Lee, who won an Academy Award for his work on Peter Jackson's film trilogy.

More on this and other stories from across the south of England.

It is being published on Thursday by HarperCollins on the 10th anniversary of the last Middle Earth book, The Children of H&#250;rin.

Tolkien specialist John Garth, who wrote Tolkien And The Great War, said the Hobbit author used his writing like an "exorcism" of the horrors he witnessed in World War One.

He said: "When he came back from the trenches, with trench fever, he spent the winter [of 1916-1917] convalescing.

"He'd lost two of his dearest friends on the Somme and you can imagine he must have been inside as much of a wreck as he was physically."

Mr Garth said on a walk in an East Yorkshire wood Tolkien's wife Edith danced in a glade filled with white flowers, which became the key scene in Beren and L&#250;thien.

He said: "Mr Tolkien felt the kind of joy he must have felt at times he would never feel again."

The names Beren and L&#250;thien are carved on the gravestone Tolkien and his wife share in Wolvercote cemetery in Oxford.

The story is about the fate of lovers Beren and L&#250;thien, a mortal man and an immortal elf who together try to steal from the greatest of all evil beings, Melkor.

For the new book Christopher Tolkien, now aged 92, has kept his father's story in the original form in which it was written and has also shown how the narrative changed to become part of The Silmarillion.

Published in 1954, The Lord of the Rings was the sequel to The Hobbit and is one of the most successful novels ever written, having sold more than 150 million copies.

The film adaptation, released from 2001 to 2003, is one of the highest-grossing series of all time, with the final movie also winning 11 Academy Awards, tied for the most ever with Ben Hur.

2020 Australian Open Venue: Melbourne Park Dates: 20 January to 2 February Coverage: Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra and online; Live text on selected matches on the BBC Sport website and app.

She has been retired for more than seven years, has a hectic life as a mum of three and is not as "fit and fast" as she used to be, but Kim Clijsters believes she will still be competitive on her return to tennis.

The former world number one, 36, is making her comeback in March after a knee injury put the brakes on plans to return at next week's Australian Open.

In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Sport, she explains what motivated her to take to the court once again, which players she is looking forward to facing and what she makes of the air quality issues the players are facing at the Australian Open.

She says a lot has changed while she has been away - but can she still do the splits?

'I would be vocal' on air quality issue

The media day at her academy in her hometown of Bree in Belgium was supposed to be all about the four-time Grand Slam champion's much-anticipated return to tennis, but Clijsters inevitably found herself being asked about the air quality issues in Melbourne, where qualifying has been delayed because of poor air quality due to bushfires and players have had breathing problems.

Clijsters says if she was at the Australian Open she would be "vocal" in getting organisers to explain how they are going to deal with the issue when the main draw starts on Monday.

"If it's not possible to play in then what's the point?" she said.

"If you can't play and bring good tennis and be fit enough to play two hours, or even the guys 4-5 hours in this environment. You can't avoid or ignore it.

"They have delayed matches but it's not going to solve the air quality. On the centre and show courts there is not an issue - they can close the roof and they can have the ventilation on but on the outside courts&#8230; you can't play a whole event just on a few show courts that have a roof.

"If I would have been there I think I would have been very vocal and at least talk to the board and the tournament directors to try to think about solutions."

She said some of the players from her academy are involved in the qualifying event and have been talking about how hard it has been.

They feel the struggles at night, the coughing," Clijsters said. "It's a tough situation to be in. It's something that's out of anyone's control. It's important that players stay healthy."

She praised player efforts to raise money for the relief fund to help the crisis, in which at least 28 people have died and an estimated 10 million hectares (100,000 sq km) of land has burned since 1 July.

"Tennis is a sport that has always come together very well to try and make money for [disasters]," said Clijsters, speaking hours after tennis greats Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal were among a number of players to feature in a charity match for the bushfire appeal.

"Everybody cares about it, they all love the Australian Open, we just have to make sure that the people stay safe and healthy."

What made Clijsters come out of retirement (again!)?

After years as a TV pundit, Clijsters is now getting used to being back on the other side of the microphone as a player

Clijsters, who first retired in 2007 at the age of 23 to start a family, hung up her racquet for a second time in 2012 and has since thrown herself into being a busy mum as well as working as a TV pundit and playing at various Legends events.

But while she commentated on players like Serena Williams, who is still winning titles at the age of 38, she had a nagging feeling that she might not quite be done.

"Whenever I went to a couple of tournaments, even if I was doing commentating or if I was playing some legends, at the back of my mind at times I still felt I could still be a player - I'm not saying win Grand Slams, but be a player and not be among the legends or not doing commentary - still being competitive," she said.

"Then I would come home and be in craziness of the hectic life with kids and be like 'yeah, it's not possible'."

That was until her youngest son started school.

"I thought this will maybe give me some time and maybe I should just see how far my body can go and just go from there," she said.

"Maybe this can lead to coming back or playing a few tournaments a year, see how I will react. It very easily could have gone the other way."

The other key element was the rule that as a former world number one, Clijsters is eligible for unlimited wildcards at WTA tournaments. And there is no prescribed number of events that she has to play at.

"If they told me I had to play 16 tournaments a year and I have to go here, here and here, I would have said it was impossible to combine it but in this situation I can combine it," she said.

She is due to make her comeback in March and has wildcards for the events in Monterrey, Indian Wells, and Charleston.

Asked if anyone had tried to talk her out of returning, she laughed: "At least not to my face, behind my back maybe a little bit."

How will she fare against the new generation?

Clijsters, who won 41 WTA titles and spent 20 weeks as world number one, has not set herself - publicly - any goals for her comeback in terms of rankings or results.

But she is looking forward to mixing with a new generation of players, who she has been observing from afar.

"Simona Halep is not a young player but is someone I've never played against - the way she played against Serena [Williams] in that Wimbledon final [last year] was incredible to watch," she said.

"Bianca Andreescu - what she did at the US Open [when she beat Williams in the 2019 final]. Naomi Osaka is a player I enjoy watching - not just on the court but her press conferences. [American 15-year-old] Coco Gauff is definitely a girl I have my eyes on, especially in the big events. Fun girls, interesting."

It is not just the players who have changed since she played her last competitive match at the 2012 US Open.

"There is more and more science behind things these days, for my trainer and my osteopath - they also look at treatments differently. There is the cold therapies, so many new approaches to help," she said.

"I've been trying to go more - not fully vegan - but trying to be more healthy. You look at food that triggers inflammation differently. [But] there are things that haven't changed - I was a big believer in deep tissue massage back in the day - and I still do that."

Can she still do the splits?

Clijsters' splits were a trademark of her game

Clijsters was always well known for her agility on court - often doing the splits when trying to get to shots. Unsurprising, perhaps, given that her mother was a gymnast.

And it sounds like we can expect to see some more.

"A few weeks ago when I was on training camp I did [the splits] out of the blue. Everybody on the sideline stopped and was kind of like 'why did you do that?', I was like 'sorry, I don't know, how it happened'," she smiled.

"I should be able to, just make sure I'm fit enough to get back up again with no pulled muscles."

Despite her return already being postponed because of a knee injury, she has not been put off by the physical pressures.

"The knee was an out-of-the-blue bad luck thing. If you put in the time, and you look at everything around you - the diet, the sleep, then you are capable of doing a lot of things," she said.

"If I do all that - I'm not saying I'm going to be as fit and as fast and do the splits like I used to do - I do think I'm capable of getting to a certain level that I feel happy with. It doesn't have to be a contender for a Grand Slam but to put myself for a level where I'm happy - that's the goal."

But before all that, though, she tells us she needs to take her daughter to basketball practice.

If you are going to travel 6,000 miles for every game you might as well ensure you make history in the process.

That's exactly what amateur side JS Saint-Pierroise - from the volcanic Indian Ocean island of Reunion - have done by reaching the last 32 of the French Cup.

Reunion is a French overseas territory and, as such, its teams are eligible for the competition. On Saturday they will face SAS Epinal, becoming only the second overseas team to reach this stage after Guiana side ASC Le Geldar.

Saint-Pierre have won the Reunion Premier League for five consecutive seasons but this achievement easily surpasses that.

To get this far the island amateurs had to defeat Ligue 2 side Niort 2-1 away from home in the last round. Overcoming a second-tier side is no easy task, especially when it takes an 11-hour flight just to get there.

In the Saint-Pierre side at Niort was former Blackpool midfielder Elliot Grandin, who joined at the start of the season, having decided he wanted to try something different. The Frenchman has ended up being part of one of his country's biggest football stories of the season.

"It was crazy - all the people in the media spoke about the victory," Grandin explains. "It's never happened before so it's been a very big thing. People are happy because it's a rare story. It's very good because people do not know much about Reunion football, so it's a great opportunity for the players over there to show their talent, and this is what we did. Now people take us seriously."

The distances involved has been a blessing in disguise, forcing the squad to make the journey a week in advance to avoid jet lag and prepare for the fixtures on the mainland.

"We stay in the hotel together, we prepare for a week before the game but it's not easy as it's quite far," Grandin adds. "It's not easy to come every two weeks to play but we appreciate the time we spend in France."

The total journey time between Reunion and France is more than one day, according to Google Maps

Surprisingly, given the logistical challenges, the club's following across land and sea is incredibly dedicated. There were pyrotechnics and deafening chants once Niort were dispatched, with hundreds having travelled all the way from the middle of the Indian Ocean to the west of France.

"People are crazy about football over there. The stadium in Niort was full of Reunion people and I was like 'wow, I know this guy - he comes to the stadium in Reunion every time. I know this guy and this guy'. They were singing, dancing and every time we play away in France the stadium is full of Reunion people - it is crazy. I don't know how they do it with the travel but they keep coming back."

Niort immediately sacked their manager after losing to this supposed bunch of amateurs but there is far more to the Saint-Pierre squad than meets the eye.

Grandin has played in Ligue 1 and the Premier League, having also represented France Under-21s. Last season ex-Liverpool striker Florent Sinama Pongolle - who is from Reunion - was on their books. Saint-Pierre-born Dimitri Payet, the France midfielder who spent 18 months at West Ham, was with them as a youth player.

"We were confident before the game because we have a good team with good players," says Grandin. "We have some players who have played in professional leagues in France or England and we have some young talents, experienced players and very fast players."

Dimitri Payet was a youth player for three clubs on Reunion Island

Next up are fourth-tier SAS Epinal, meaning the experienced Saint-Pierre side will be hoping they can repeat the trick to add another chapter to their story.

"For the island it is already history to make it to this round but we will do everything to carry on to the next one," says Grandin.

"We have to spend the week preparing well, we have to be confident, we have to not forget to keep working and I hope we get to the next round."

The club have made headlines around the world, which is appropriate as they have to travel around half of it for each match. Ian Holloway, the manager who brought Grandin to the Premier League, has been in touch with the midfielder to congratulate him on his latest success.

A win at the weekend would send them into the last 16 and offer another chance of drawing one of France's biggest clubs. But even if they lose in Epinal, the Reunionese will still have plenty to be proud about.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-45604199<category>health</category><title>Hernia mesh complications 'affect more than 100,000'</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Ellis says complications following his hernia mesh operation nearly led him to take his own life

Up to 170,000 people who have had hernia mesh implants in England in the past six years could face complications, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has found.

In that time, there have been about 570,000 operations and some surgeons say the complication rate is 12-30%.

Some patients have been left unable to walk or work, others left suicidal.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency backs the use of hernia mesh.

Image caption Mesh is used in more than 90,000 hernia operations in England each year

One in 10 people will develop a hernia.

The most common treatment involves a doctor pushing any bulging tissue back into the body and covering it with a piece of surgical mesh.

There have been between 90,000 and 100,000 hernia mesh operations in England each year since 2011-12.

And leading surgeons believe the complication rate is 12-30% - which means between 68,000 and 170,000 patients could have been adversely affected in the past six years.

Mesh has been used for hernia repairs since the 1990s, so the total number who have experienced complications since its introduction is thought to be much higher.

But NHS trusts in England have no consistent policy for guidelines on treatment or follow-up with patients.

Jen's story

Image caption Jen Coles had to use a cane to walk following her mesh implant

After Jen Coles, 34, had a mesh implant in January 2017, following her hernia, the operation left her with chronic pain.

"I was hunched over and walking as though I was elderly and I couldn't stand up straight and it hurt all the time," she said.

"I had a cane because I just felt really unsteady on my feet."

She has since had a repair operation to remove two large pieces of mesh.

Image copyright Jen Coles Image caption Jen Coles was active, with lots of hobbies, before her mesh implant

Her family paid for the operation because they feared it would take years on the NHS.

Her overall mobility has improved, and the pain decreased, but she still struggles to do certain tasks.

"Sometimes, I just want to scream. It's maddening," she said.

"[Before the mesh implant] I was so active - running around commuting, kayaking, and now I can't pick up a sock from the floor."

Labour MP Owen Smith, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Surgical Mesh Implants, said he feared the UK could "potentially have another scandal on our hands".

He said the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), whose job it is to ensure medical devices are safe, was not doing enough to listen to the experiences of patients affected.

"It reflects the flawed system we have in place," he said. "Neither the regulators or the manufacturers have to follow up on problems.

"Companies ultimately have to take some responsibility for this.

"It's not good for them to give this to the NHS and then they walk away with the NHS carrying any liability."

The MHRA told the BBC it had "not had any evidence which would lead us to alter our stance on surgical mesh for hernia repairs or other surgical procedures for which they are used".

"The decision to use mesh should be made between patient and clinician, recognising the benefits and risks," it added.

The Royal College of Surgeons said mesh implants were the "most effective way" to deal with a hernia.

Image caption Dr Ulrike Muschaweck has performed 3,000 mesh removals

Dr Ulrike Muschaweck, a leading hernia surgeon in the private sector, said she used a suture technique - instead of mesh - for most hernia operations but this method was dying out because young surgeons were rarely taught it.

She said she had performed 3,000 mesh removals because of chronic pain - after which only two of the patients had not gone on to become "pain-free".

Dr Suzy Elneil, a consultant urogynaecologist who was a leading voice in the successful campaign to halt the use of vaginal mesh on the NHS in England, estimated treating those who had experienced complications with hernia mesh could cost a minimum of &#163;25,000 a patient.

This includes:

the removal of the mesh

a further operation to treat the hernia

follow-up care

It is similar to the predicted cost for those treated for vaginal mesh complications.

The decision to move the Africa Cup of Nations back to January could see more than 30 current Premier League players miss up to six matches and could "put managers off" making signings.

The 2019 tournament - won by Algeria - was held in June and July but next year's edition has been moved back to January.

Premier League leaders Liverpool could lose Senegal's Sadio Mane, Egypt's Mohamed Salah and Guinea's Naby Keita for a month next season.

"It definitely affects your thinking when it comes to signing African players," former Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp told BBC World Service.

"Invariably when they come back from the tournament, they're not the same. They don't seem to recover from the rigours of the Cup of Nations."

Why has the tournament moved?

The 2017 decision to move the start of the competition to June, from January, was widely welcomed, especially by top European clubs.

But next year's competition will take place from 9 January to 6 February, 2021, having been moved because of weather conditions in host country Cameroon - where there were highs of 33C on Wednesday.

The change also means that the tournament will not clash with the expanded Club World Cup, being held in China in June 2021.

"You'll suddenly lose players for six to eight weeks because they will go away to a training camp before," Redknapp told the Sport Today programme.

"When you're signing players, you do look at it and if they're going away to the Cup of Nations, sometimes you think: 'I'll give this one a miss.'

'I've lost contracts because of the tournament'

Further down the footballing pyramid, the move could also hamper a player's club career.

Dagenham &amp; Redbridge defender Gabriel Zakuani - a former DR Congo captain and Peterborough, Northampton and Gillingham player - says he missed out on signing for clubs in the past because he would be away for so long during the season.

"I've had offers of a new contract taken off the table because I decided to go to the Cup of Nations," he told Sport Today.

"I can understand it from the point of view of managers but we want to go and we want to win it. I've had managers pulling their hair out every time I've had to go but it's tradition.

"The weather is better in that period in Cameroon [the winter]; we need the best Cup of Nations for African football and that's the right time to play it. It's as important in a career as anything else."

Australia is fighting one of its worst bushfire seasons, fuelled by record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought.

Since September, at least 25 people have died and thousands have been made homeless.

Here's a very simple guide to what's going on:

Where are the fires?

Every state and territory in Australia has experienced fires this summer. But the biggest fires burn along stretches of the eastern and southern coast, where most of the population lives.

This includes areas around Sydney and Adelaide.

How big are the Australia fires?

More than 6.3 million hectares (63,000 sq km or 15.6 million acres) have been burned so far - one hectare is roughly the size of a sports field.

Image copyright EPA

To put that in perspective, around 800,000 hectares in 2018 in California.

How did the Australia fires start?

Australia has always experienced bushfires - it has a "fire season". But this year they are a lot worse than normal.

Fires are usually caused by lightning strikes or accidentally by a spark - but some fires are also started deliberately.

Are the Australia fires caused by climate change?

This year a natural weather phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole has meant a hot, dry spell across the country.

But the overwhelming scientific consensus is that rising levels of CO2 are warming the planet. And Australia has been getting hotter over recent decades and is expected to continue doing so.

This year, Australia twice set a new temperature record: an average maximum of 41.9C was recorded on 18 December. That comes on top of a long period of drought.

Scientists have long warned that this hotter, drier climate will contribute to fires becoming more frequent and more intense.

The more extreme weather patterns and higher temperatures increase the risk of bushfires and allow them to spread faster and wider.

How are the fires fought?

Firefighters are spraying water and fire retardant from planes and helicopters as well as from the ground.

But fighting bush fires is extremely difficult and often authorities have to focus on just stopping the spread, rather than putting the fire out.

The spread can for instance be contained by digging earth boundaries to stop the flames from spreading. The priority is saving lives.

Who is fighting the fires?

Professional firefighters are the first in line to battle the flames, but they are outnumbered by the thousands of volunteers. Three of them have died.

There's also help coming from abroad: the US, Canada, and New Zealand have sent firefighters to help.

Australia's police, military and navy are involved in rescue and evacuation efforts.

How many animals have died in the fires?

While people can flee the fires and are being evacuated if need be, the flames are devastating wildlife in the affected areas.

One study estimated that half a billion animals have died in NSW alone. Read more on how they reached that conclusion here.

But the fires don't only kill animals directly, they also destroy the habitat, leaving the survivors vulnerable even once the fires have gone. So the true scale of loss isn't yet clear.

Experts say more than 100,000 cows and sheep may also have been lost, which is devastating for farmers.

What is the government doing?

Each state runs its own emergency operation, but Prime Minister Scott Morrison has promised better funding for firefighting and payouts for volunteer firefighters, and an additional A$2bn ($1.4bn; &#163;1bn) for the recovery.

But the national government has come under strong criticism from its opponents that it's not been doing enough against climate change.

The country is one of the world's biggest per capita greenhouse gas emitters but under international agreements it has committed itself to reduction targets.

Mr Morrison has repeatedly defended his government's stance.

A large metal plate launched by an explosion at a chemical plant in Spain's autonomous Catalonia region killed a man 3km (two miles) away.

The man, named only as Sergio, was in his apartment when the one tonne object struck, causing part of the building to collapse, officials have confirmed.

A factory employee was also killed in Tuesday's blast. Another worker died from injuries on Wednesday.

The explosion occurred at about 18:40 local time (17:40 GMT) in La Canonja.

Authorities said it was probably caused by a chemical accident, but that no toxic substances were released.

People were, however, initially urged to stay indoors when the explosion at the site just south of Tarragona set off a huge fire.

Residents of the Pla&#231;a Garc&#237;a Lorca housing estate in nearby Torreforta, where the man was killed, described seeing "a ball of fire" stream across the sky at the time of the incident.

Firefighters later confirmed that this was a metal plate from the factory site, which they said weighed about a tonne.

Local resident Antonia Mora told Spanish newspaper El Pais "it was like a bomb".

Witnesses described seeing a large object hit the building, causing damage to the exterior.

Dozens of firefighters worked through the night and into Wednesday to tackle the blaze at the Industrias Qu&#237;micas del &#211;xido de Etileno plant.

A reporter for Spanish public broadcaster RTVE, Jes&#250;s Navarro, tweeted an image showing a mangled structure at the factory site.

Water was sprayed over tanks containing chemicals to keep them cool.

The factory produces chemicals such as ethylene oxide - which can be used to make antifreeze, pesticides and to sterilise hospital equipment - and propylene oxide, which is used to make plastics. Both are extremely flammable.

Rescue teams with search dogs found the body of the second victim, a senior staff member at the factory, in the early hours of Wednesday. The search had been called off overnight due to poor visibility and dangerous conditions.

Eight people were injured in the explosion, and one of them died on Wednesday.

Late on Tuesday Catalan leader Quim Torra told reporters: "Now we can send a message of calm and confidence to people. There is no toxicity and therefore people can carry on with their lives as normal."

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S&#225;nchez later offered support to Catalan authorities in dealing with the accident.

Roads and public transport systems in the area that were closed as a precaution were reopened on Wednesday.</text><tags>Catalonia, Spain</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/51140192<category>sport</category><title>Bruno Fernandes: Manchester United target will play in Lisbon derby on Friday</title><text>Bruno Fernandes joined Sporting from Italian side Sampdoria in 2017

Manchester United target Bruno Fernandes will face Benfica in Friday's Lisbon derby "unless disaster strikes", says Sporting Lisbon boss Silas.

United and Sporting have held face-to-face talks over the transfer of &#163;60m-rated midfielder Fernandes.

The Portugal international, 25, is keen on a move but there has been no agreement between the clubs over a fee.

"The only certainty I have is that Bruno Fernandes will be present against Benfica," said Silas.

"When we have such an athlete it is normal for a lot of teams to want him, but tomorrow he will be there unless disaster strikes."

Sporting, who are currently fourth in the Primeira Liga, host leaders Benfica at the Jose Alvalade Stadium at 21:15 GMT on Friday.

United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his assistant, Mike Phelan, watched Fernandes play against FC Porto on 5 January.

Silas said there is "no player in Portugal who does" what Fernandes can do.

"He is an extraordinary player, the best and most valuable in the league, as he was last season," he added.

"I've heard someone say that he's not worth the money you are talking about and it's true, he's worth a lot more.

"In addition to attacking better than anyone in our country, he still gives the most to defend."</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51104776<category>world</category><title>Our Planet Matters: What's the BBC plan all about?</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Our Planet Matters: Climate change explained

The BBC has announced plans for a year-long series of special programming and coverage on climate change.

A raft of news services and shows are planned as part of the Our Planet Matters project.

These include a new monthly Climate Check video feature from BBC Weather, and coverage of debates and events around the globe.

Digital, TV and radio outlets will all take part.

Sir David Attenborough also plans a new hour-long documentary for the Our Planet Matters programmes. Extinction: The Facts will examine the fragile state of the natural world.

"We have to realise that this is not playing games," Sir David told the BBC. "This is an urgent problem that has to be solved and, what's more, we know how to do it."

How can I follow?

Online, the BBC will produce new explainers, interactive tools and guides to help sort through the jargon and analyse what's happening in the UK and across our changing planet. You can check back on everything that has been published so far here.

BBC.com will launch Future Planet, looking at how people around the world are confronting the problems created by climate change.

In a new series for BBC Two, Ade Adepitan travels to countries on the frontline of climate change to find out what humanity is doing to face up to possibly the greatest challenge in our history in a three part series, Ade on the Frontline of Climate Change.

Radio 4's PM programme will air The Environment in 10 Objects. Each episode will look at the environmental impact of one household item, and how we can respond to the climate crisis at home.

A new weekly podcast on the World Service will examine climate change from scientific, business and policy perspectives with the help of journalists from around the world.

BBC Weather meanwhile plans to bring in a monthly Climate Check service, to help audiences see trends behind the daily weather.

Adam Bullimore, head of BBC Weather, says it will be a chance to "share something more with audiences than just the typical weather forecast", and will focus on the impact of data like CO2 emissions and Arctic sea ice measurements on our planet.

The BBC will also cover the build up to the COP 26 climate summit in Glasgow this November. On Friday, BBC Breakfast and the News Channel will be live from Glasgow's Science Centre talking about plans to make Scotland's biggest city carbon neutral by 2030, and how this will affect its people.

In the summer, the BBC will host a climate debate. Experts and people from around the UK will be brought together at the audience event.

What about abroad?

Our worldwide network of BBC correspondents will report on the effects of climate change on the environment and communities from all corners of the globe.

Image caption The BBC's global network of correspondents will cover climate issues from around the globe

That even includes Antarctica. Chief environment correspondent Justin Rowlatt will be reporting from the remote Thwaites Glacier, where researchers are trying to find out the stability of the colossal ice mass.

All through 2020 the BBC will report on which countries, people and technologies are leading the way in tackling climate change.

Scientific work will also be a key focus. There will be coverage of how researchers are trying to understand the pace of climate change and its effects on the natural world.

How is the BBC doing on its own climate targets?

According to the BBC press office, the corporation reduced its carbon footprint by 78% last year by purchasing renewable electricity to match that used at major sites and is on track to remove all single-use plastics from BBC sites by the end of 2020.

The corporation now aims to go carbon neutral and has launched a project to identify what action is needed and how quickly it can be achieved.

"We're committed to responsible travel policies including only travelling when necessary, using technology such as videoconferencing, improving the fuel efficiency of our vehicle fleet and introducing electric vehicles," a statement reads. "Currently one of our contractors offsets CO2 emissions on our flights with them and we are exploring whether there's scope to do more."

BBC Director of News, Fran Unsworth, said: "We are very aware of our own impact on the environment and our responsible travel policy means we only fly when necessary."

Google is to restrict the number of advertising cookies on websites accessed via its Chrome browser, in response to calls for greater privacy controls.

It said that it would phase out third-party cookies within the next two years,

Cookies are small text files that are used to track users across the web.

It comes as a study suggests that many cookie consent pop-ups are flouting EU privacy laws.

Justin Schuh, Google's director of Chrome engineering, said in a blogpost: "Users are demanding greater privacy - including transparency, choice and control over how their data is used - and it's clear the web ecosystem needs to evolve to meet these increasing demands."

Third-party cookies, which follow users from site to site tracing their browsing habits, have also been banned by Apple, Microsoft and Mozilla.

Websites will still be able to use their own first-party cookies to track users.

The move comes as Ireland's data protection authority investigates Google's online advertising business and the practice of real-time bidding for online ads.

'Dark design' tricks

Image copyright Michael Veale Image caption The research team's mock-up of a clear "decline" option

Meanwhile, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University College London (UCL) and Aarhus University have conducted a joint study into the use of cookies.

They analysed five companies which offer consent management platforms (CMP) for cookies used by the UK's top 10,000 websites.

Despite EU privacy laws stating that consent for cookies must be informed, specific and freely given, the research suggests that only 11.8% of the sites met the minimal requirements of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) law.

Instead they were found to blanket data consent options in complicated site design, such as:

pre-ticked boxes

"burying" decline buttons on later pages

multiple clicks

tracking users before consent and after pressing "reject"

Just over half the sites studied did not have "rejecting all" tracking as an option.

Of the sites which did, only 12.6% made it accessible through the same or fewer clicks as the option to "accept all".

Quantcast, the largest company analysed, typically asks for permission to share data with 542 different companies, explains study co-author Michael Veale, from UCL.

In response, the firm told the BBC: "Our default recommended settings grant equal prominence to the "I Accept" and "I Do Not Accept" buttons, and do not pre-select choices for any data processing purposes. While we strongly encourage that these defaults are used, website owners ultimately retain control over the customisation and presentation of their properties.

Crownpeak, another CMP provider, said that its default configuration was also set up to enforce prior consent.

The researchers estimate it would take, on average, more than half an hour to read through what the third-party companies are doing with your data, and even longer to read all their privacy policies.

"It's a joke and there's no actual way you could do this realistically," said Dr Veale.

"Consent should always have been a clear positive action, laws on tracking have been unenforced for a decade and the result is regulators not knowing where to start to cope with the scale of the widespread illegality."

Image caption The BBC site has followed ICO guidelines by having a clear "no" option on not "laying" consent behind further clicks

When the GDPR came into force in 2018, it "hugely upped enforcement powers and clarified what 'consent' meant, leading many to expect industry to pay close attention", explains Newcastle University law professor Lilian Edwards.

Prof Edwards said there has been "limited effort to enforce the cookie rules" over the last decade and no post-GDPR fines have been made in the UK or Ireland, even though regulators can fine companies up to 4% of their global turnover.

"The problem is that getting large fines through post-GDPR is proving a very long process," she added.

Protection

Tracker blockers can be downloaded to protect web users.

Browser extensions such as Privacy Badger, created by digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, entirely block data trackers.

Part of the study's research team also created Consent-o-matic - a tool which users can programme to remember their consent rejections and apply them to new sites.

But Dr Veale says: "I want to see a web where users don't need to distrust sites in the way they need to now, for personal privacy and computer security."</text><tags>Data protection, Internet privacy, GDPR</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51117515<category>business</category><title>Amazon in India: Jeff Bezos announces $1bn Indian investment</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images

Speaking at a company event in New Delhi, he also said the 21st Century is "going to be the Indian century".

The e-commerce billionaire's three-day visit to India is expected to be marred by protests.

Thousands of small traders across 300 cities have planned demonstrations against what they see as Amazon's negative impact on the local retail market.

They allege Amazon is driving them out of business by offering sharply discounted products and favouring a few big sellers on its platform.

Amazon denies the allegations.

During today's address Mr Bezos said: "The dynamism, the energy... the growth. This country has something special - and it's a democracy."

He also said the online retail giant expects to export $10bn worth of India-made goods by 2025, and that Amazon has already committed to $5.5bn of investment in the country.

India's e-commerce market is currently dominated by Amazon and Flipkart, which is owned by US retail giant Walmart.

But both companies suffered a setback last year when the Indian government introduced new laws that restrict foreign-owned online retailers from selling goods from their own subsidiaries.

Earlier this month a conglomerate run by Asia's richest man has started a service that aims to compete with Amazon in India.

Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries said it had been inviting people to sign up to its grocery delivery service.

The US Senate formally received the articles on impeachment from the House on Thursday.

The whole process has been more colourful, and dramatic, than your standard Congress fare.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi used several pens to put her signature on the impeachment bill - annoying Republicans - before House Democrats and the House clerk formally marched over to the Senate Chamber to present the articles.

And the sergeant at arms kicked off proceedings on Thursday with a medieval-sounding threat: "Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all persons are commanded to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment."

It's rare to see so much pomp and circumstance in the US Congress, which typically has far fewer ceremonial traditions than the UK's Parliament.

Here's a breakdown of what happened, and what it means.

A 'funny signature' with many pens

Ms Pelosi and her team held an engrossment ceremony on Wednesday evening, where she signed the final articles of impeachment. This is the last, formal step the House takes before it hands over the impeachment proceedings to the Senate.

It took her some time - because she used a different pen for each stroke, joking: "It makes a funny signature."

Reporters snapped photos of four trays, each holding eight pens engraved with Ms Pelosi's name, before the signing ceremony.

This is actually a long-standing US tradition - since President Franklin Roosevelt, presidents have frequently used multiple pens to sign high-profile pieces of legislation, so they can be offered as souvenirs and historical keepsakes.

President Donald Trump joked that he was running out of pens as he signed legislation on his inauguration day - while President Barack Obama used 22 pens to sign the Affordable Care Act into law.

Ms Pelosi has faced criticism for using several pens to sign the impeachment articles - with Republican critics saying she appeared to be celebrating what was supposed to be a sombre moment.

Her office, however, argued that while impeachment is "tragic... it is indisputably historic when the Constitution and its balance of power reasserts itself."

Back in 1998, Republican senators also kept pens as souvenirs after signing oaths for the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton - although those pens had typos on the text inscribed on them, and had to be reissued.

An impeachment walk - twice

Following Wednesday's signing, the House clerk walked across the Capitol, under the iconic Rotunda, to deliver the two articles of impeachment to the Senate.

She was accompanied by the House Sergeant at Arms and the seven impeachment managers.

It was a rare moment when members of the House formally crossed over to the Senate - typically, the two chambers function separately.

The tradition of the procession is thought to go back to the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in 1868. Lawmakers also made the same walk in 1998, when carrying articles impeaching President Bill Clinton.

"Ceremony and precedence play a role in strengthening the way in which legislative bodies function," Prof Richard Arenberg, an expert in Congressional history and procedures at Brown University, and a former Capitol Hill staffer, told the BBC.

The procession "symbolises the transmission of the solemn document enacted by the House of Representatives, and acceptance of it by the Senate".

When the procession arrived at the Senate chamber, the House clerk informed the Senate that the House had passed a resolution appointing the impeachment managers, and the Senate President, Republican Charles E Grassley, replied "the message will be received".

House Democrats had to make the walk again on Thursday, as Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell asked them to return to formally exhibit the articles of impeachment then.

'Hear ye hear ye'

You wouldn't normally hear medieval English in the Senate.

But on Thursday, the sergeant of arms - Senate's chief law enforcement officer - kicked off proceedings by announcing: "Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against Donald John Trump, president of the United States".

Why did he sound so formal? Most of the words he used are actually set out in the Senate impeachment rules, which were developed in 1868 and last revised in 1986.

"This is only the third impeachment trial in US history - a lot of the procedures have come through two centuries, without routine use, so they may seem archaic," Prof Arenberg says.

Nonetheless, he adds, the traditions and ceremonies that have developed help underline the "seriousness" and "sober gravity" of what it taking place.

Signing the oath book

The Senate impeachment rules also specify that when it is the president or vice-president who is being impeached, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court should preside over the trial.

Chief Justice Roberts had to be formally sworn in, before administering oaths for all 100 senators, who also had to sign an oath book that is kept in the national archives.

Prof Arenberg says it is significant that they are required to take a separate oath.

"This is an additional oath above their oath of office - it's to underline that this is different from the partisan and legislative procedures they normally go through. Even beyond the oath of the Constitution when they take office, they need to additionally swear to offer impartial justice in this trial."

The Senate then issued a formal summons to President Trump, informing him of the charges against him.

The trial is set to reconvene on Tuesday.

UFC 246: McGregor v Cerrone Date: Sunday 19 January (UK time) Venue: T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas Coverage: Approximately 03:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, then switching to BBC Radio 5 Live from 04:30. Also live text commentary on BBC Sport website.

Conor McGregor will step inside the octagon at UFC 246 for the first time in 15 months when he takes on Donald 'Cowboy' Cerrone in Las Vegas on Saturday.

While McGregor is a global star never far from the headlines, Cerrone is relatively unknown outside the mixed martial arts community.

So what do we know about the man from Denver, Colorado, nicknamed 'Cowboy'?

Here are five facts about one of the UFC's most enduring athletes.

He is a big deal in the UFC

At 36 years old, Cerrone is nearing the end of a storied MMA career in which he has amassed a number of impressive UFC records.

He has fought 33 times in the UFC, sharing the record with fellow American Jim Miller.

Of those fights, he has won 23, more than anyone in the history of the promotion.

He has racked up 16 finishes and 20 knockdowns, and taken home 18 post-fight bonuses - all of which are UFC records.

Cerrone submitted Mike Perry by armbar in 2018 to break the record for most wins in the UFC

Despite his impressive statistics, Cerrone has only ever had one title fight in the UFC - a first-round defeat by lightweight Rafael dos Anjos in 2015.

A win in Las Vegas against McGregor would surely put him in contention for another.

His rivalry with McGregor goes way back

Although the fight between Cerrone and McGregor was only confirmed in November, the seeds of the rivalry were sown in 2015.

Back then, as McGregor was promoting his featherweight title fight against Jose Aldo, Cerrone was preparing for his lightweight title bout against Dos Anjos.

The UFC held a media conference with all fighters involved.

McGregor and Cerrone first goaded each other back in 2015

McGregor had previously expressed interest at fighting at lightweight, so Cerrone responded saying he wouldn't stand a chance.

"Conor has no right coming up to 155 [lbs] - there's no way. We're too big for him and too strong," said Cerrone.

Naturally, McGregor hit back.

"You're too slow and too stiff, I'd snap you in half," he said.

"I have my eye on that 155 division and I see them all stuck in the mud there."

Cerrone has also called out McGregor numerous times over the years, most notably following his win over Al Iaquinta at UFC Ottawa last May.

He lives up to his 'Cowboy' nickname

In true cowboy style, Cerrone owns his own ranch - the BMF Ranch in Edgewood, New Mexico.

He bought the ranch just over 10 years ago after moving to Albuquerque from his home in Denver.

This is where Cerrone lives, sleeps, trains and enjoys a lot of his downtime.

Cerrone shares a lot of his ranch activities on his Instagram page

The ranch is extraordinary.

There is a gym, where fighters come to train from all over the world, complete with dormitories for the athletes to live in.

Cerrone trains and hosts other fighters at his training camp in New Mexico

He raises his own animals, including goats, turkeys and pigs, which he kills for food.

There's a shooting range, a huge sauna and even a paintball arena.

And the most amazing part of it?

Cerrone built it all himself.

He's a thrill-seeker

Fighting for a living would produce more than enough adrenaline for most people - not for Cerrone.

Before he started fighting, he was a professional bull rider - a rodeo sport not for the faint-hearted.

It's a dangerous activity where riders attempt to stay mounted on a bull while it tries to buck them off.

Nowadays, Cerrone gets his adrenaline fix in a number of different ways...

He goes hunting for his own food, slaughtering elk and moose, and then prepares them so they're ready to eat at home.

He goes surfing and rock-climbing, and takes his one-year-old son Dacson Danger out snowmobiling.

Then there's the incredibly tense story, which you can find on Youtube, of how he nearly died while cave-diving.

He loves beer like McGregor loves whiskey

Away from the octagon, it's not uncommon to see Cerrone with a beer in his hand.

Just like McGregor has his own brand of whiskey, Cerrone has his own special branded beer.

The beverage can be bought in the USA during the build-up to the McGregor fight, and comes with the message "brewed and canned for Cowboy fans".

A year ago, Cowboy even offered to share a drink with McGregor on Instagram.

It would be a fitting conclusion to the rivalry if they both end up sharing some beverages after the fight in Las Vegas.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39754909<category>world</category><title>Turkish authorities block Wikipedia without giving reason</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images/PeterMacdiarmid Image caption Turkish people awoke to find all access to Wikipedia had been blocked

Turkey has blocked all access inside the country to the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia.

Officials said "an administrative measure" had been taken, but gave no reason why.

Turkish media said authorities had asked Wikipedia to remove content by writers "supporting terror".

Turkey has temporarily blocked social media sites including Facebook and Twitter in the past, usually following protests or terror attacks.

The Turkey Blocks monitoring group said Wikipedia was unreachable from 08:00 (05:00 GMT). People in Istanbul were unable to access any pages without using a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

"After technical analysis and legal consideration based on the Law Nr. 5651 [governing the internet], an administrative measure has been taken for this website," Turkey's Information and Communication Technologies Authority was quoted as saying, giving no further details.

However, the Hurriyet daily newspaper said Wikipedia had been asked to remove content by certain writers whom the authorities accuse of "supporting terror" and of linking Turkey to terror groups. The site had not responded to the demands, Hurriyet said, and the ban was imposed as a result.

Turkey Blocks and Turkish media, including Hurriyet, said the provisional order would need to be backed by a full court ruling in the next few days.

Another day, another outage - by Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey Correspondent

It's become all too familiar here: the endless "loading" icon followed by the message "server timed out".

Blocking websites is a common tool of the Turkish authorities: Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have suffered the same fate several times, and numerous anti-government sites are inaccessible.

Critics say it smacks of Turkey's repression of free speech: over half of all requests to Twitter to remove content have come from Turkey, and the country now ranks 155 of 180 in the press freedom index of the watchdog Reporters without Borders.

Social media was in uproar as news of the ban emerged, with some users speculating that it might be a bid to suppress criticism on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Wikipedia page.

Mr Erdogan narrowly won a controversial 16 April referendum on increasing his powers, but the issue has deeply divided the country.

One Twitter user noted that the Wikipedia page on Turkey's referendum has a section on "controversies and electoral misconduct", and cites claims that the government suppressed the No campaign through "arrests, control of the media and political suppression".

The Turkish government has previously denied censoring the internet, blaming outages on spikes in usage after major events.

Wikipedia has also faced censorship in other countries, including a temporary ban in Russia, and repeated crackdowns in China.</text><tags>Turkey, Censorship</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-51143879<category>uk</category><title>'First Middle-earth scholar' Christopher Tolkien dies</title><text>Image copyright Charles E. Noad Image caption The Tolkien Society described Christopher Tolkien as "Middle-earth's first scholar"

Christopher Tolkien, who edited and published the posthumous works of his father, Lord of the Rings writer JRR Tolkien, has died aged 95.

The news was confirmed by the Tolkien Society, which described him as "Middle-earth's first scholar".

After his father's death in 1973, Mr Tolkien published the acclaimed work The Silmarillion.

Scholar Dr Dimitra Fimi said the study of JRR Tolkien "would never be what it is today" without his input.

Christopher Tolkien was born in Leeds, and grew up in Oxford.

After serving in the RAF during World War Two he became a lecturer in Old and Middle English and Old Icelandic at Oxford University.

Image caption JRR Tolkien made a huge impact on fantasy writing with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings

He drew the original maps of Middle-earth seen in The Lord of the Rings books released in the 1950s.

He later became the literary executor of the Tolkien Estate, completing several books set in the world of Middle-earth using his father's material from 70 boxes of unpublished work.

Tolkien Society chairman Shaun Gunner said: "Christopher's commitment to his father's works has seen dozens of publications released... we have lost a titan and he will be sorely missed."

Dr Fimi said: "From editing The Silmarillion to the mammoth task of giving us The History Of Middle-earth series, he revealed his father's grand vision of a rich and complex mythology.

"He gave us a window into Tolkien's creative process, and he provided scholarly commentary that enriched our understanding of Middle-earth."

Charlie Redmayne, HarperCollins UK CEO, described him as a "devoted curator of his father's work" who spent decades "bringing Middle-earth to generations of readers".</text><tags>Oxford, Leeds</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50265414<category>business</category><title>What went wrong with virtual reality?</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption It was thought VR would be as common as televisions, but despite improvements it is yet to take off

"When I put in the earpieces and goggles the first time it was crazy - it feels so believable," says Anna Taylor, 32, of her visit to a virtual reality (VR) arcade.

"The whole experience of being immersed in a compelling virtual world is incredible."

Anna has since visited the east London arcade many times, at first alone and then with others. But despite her enthusiasm for gaming, she won't be buying her own virtual reality headset.

"I wouldn't invest in buying virtual reality applications for home," she explains. "It's fine to play more of a basic game when you are playing with other people, [and] because it's brand new there are more layers of excitement. But when you're [playing] on your own, you want the quality you are used to."

As a keen gamer, Anna should be part of the core audience for at-home VR entertainment.

But her lack of interest is pretty common, and it means that virtual reality headsets have yet to take off.

Many big name adopters have abandoned their VR projects. Google recently halted sales of Daydream, its VR headset, admitting that "there just hasn't been the broad consumer or developer adoption we had hoped".

Meanwhile, the BBC has announced it is ending the funding for its VR hub, less than two years after it was founded.

And there were few big VR announcements at CES, the annual trade show for consumer electronics, which got underway this week.

However, PlayStation did announce it has sold five million VR headsets since launch in 2016.

Collective experience

However, one space in which virtual reality is thriving is group entertainment.

By its nature VR offers a gateway to a shared world, and in a group setting everyone gets change from &#163;20 rather than shelling out hundreds for a headset.

East London VR arcade Otherworld launched last year. It already sees 1,000 visitors a week through its doors, 60% of whom are female and half aged 25-34.

More Technology of Business

"Millennials are spending their income more and more on shared experience over consumption," says co-founder Chris Adams.

"Otherworld's immersion rooms provide the space and technology for a hyper-real, undisturbed journey into virtual reality which cannot be achieved at home."

Simon Windsor, who runs immersive media firm Hammerhead VR, has also largely kept away from the personal entertainment market.

"A few years ago there was an awful lot of hype around VR and some of that has not been fulfilled in terms of consumer adoption of the technology," Simon admits. "But the way you can interact with this world now is much more natural and intuitive."

Hammerhead uses VR to create a spectacle for big audiences in the worlds of entertainment, sport and business, alongside company training.

Simon helped create Madonna's hologram performance at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards and captured Anthony Joshua's boxing moves for Sky viewers, alongside providing training for companies like Pearson.

"Whether it's home game play, retail, virtual entertainment, a lot of the technology barriers have been removed," he says.

Beyond entertainment

Because of its immersive nature, virtual reality is also increasingly used to encourage empathy or create unique experiences.

That could be anything from headsets for children to teach them about bullying, or enabling a care home resident to swim virtually with dolphins or explore their childhood home.

It has proved particularly useful in medicine, helping surgeons experience different types of operations or distracting burns patients from pain.

Some post-traumatic stress disorder sufferers saw an almost 40% improvement in their symptoms in a trial that involved walking on a treadmill in front of a screen projecting images of the type of trauma experienced.

Mainstream use of virtual reality in our homes and workplaces was probably one of the most popular technology predictions of the past half century.

Unlike flying cars or teleportation, virtual reality headsets have been in development since the late 1960s.

There was a wave of expectation around VR in 2016, seen by many tech watchers as the year virtual reality would go mainstream.

Despite these bursts of optimism, it has never quite broken through. Today, few own their own headsets or use virtual reality in their day-to-day work.

Image copyright Otherworld Image caption Otherworld virtual reality summer background

Consultancy CCS Insights estimates 10 million headsets will be in circulation worldwide by the end of 2019, 21% growth on the previous year.

But it acknowledges this "might seem disappointing considering the huge hype" around VR, with still just a handful of successful devices available.

A major issue is that the price of headsets has remained very expensive.

"I think VR remains a very niche technology," says James Gautrey, a portfolio manager at Schroders who specialises in analysing technology stocks.

"Mass adoption remains impeded by the hardware required to run it, in my opinion. Take videogames - you need a very powerful PC, a good amount of space, sensors set up around it, and of course the VR helmet itself.

"The cost runs to thousands and for most it is completely impractical not to mention too expensive.

"There are clearly benefits using it to train people where real life 'on the job' training is dangerous, such as pilots, surgeons, deep sea divers. But beyond that and specialist video gamers, I have not seen any compelling use cases that would make it more mainstream."</text><tags>Mixed reality, Google, Lifestyle, Virtual reality</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51142585<category>uk</category><title>Grenfell Tower Inquiry: Families raise conflict of interest concerns with PM</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images

Grenfell Tower families have raised concerns to the PM about a potential conflict of interest involving a member of the inquiry into the disaster.

Benita Mehra will join chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick for the inquiry's second phase, which begins this year.

The Guardian has revealed Ms Mehra ran a charity that received funding linked to US firm Arconic, which supplied the cladding that helped the fire spread.

Seventy-two people died during the tower block fire on 14 June 2017.

Shah Aghlani, who lost his mother and aunt in the fire, told the BBC: "We have to look into it and see what the facts are and, if there's a conflict interest, I'm afraid she has to go. She has to be replaced.

"She's going to be sitting on panel judging and analysing things and we can't have any sort of conflict of interest."

He added that, in a meeting with bereaved families on Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to "listen, look into it and he'd come back to us".

A report - following the first phase of the public inquiry into the fire - found in October last year that the tower block's cladding did not comply with building regulations and was the "principal" reason for the fire's rapid and "profoundly shocking" spread.

Arconic said the grant was made by its charitable arm, the Arconic Foundation, which is "an independently endowed and managed foundation".

A spokesman added: "It's part of Arconic Foundation's mission to create access to these fields for girls and women all over the globe. The grant we awarded in 2017 to this particular UK association was purely on this basis."

Ms Mehra, a civil engineer, was appointed to the Grenfell Tower inquiry panel shortly before Christmas, replacing academic Professor Nabeel Hamdi.

It has since emerged that Ms Mehra is an immediate past president of the Women's Engineering Society (WES), which previously received funding from the Arconic Foundation for an apprentice conference.

Earlier, Karim Mussilhy, vice-chairman of the survivors and bereaved group Grenfell United, told the Guardian: "Her society has been supported by Arconic. She will look at it from the perspective of Arconic doing good things for the industry, that they are a great organisation. Her perspective will be affected."

However, a spokeswoman for the inquiry said they do not believe Ms Mehra's former role with the WES will have any influence on her ability to be impartial.

"The consideration and appointment of panel members is a matter for the Cabinet Office," said the spokeswoman.

"The inquiry does not consider that Benita Mehra's former presidency of the Women's Engineering Society in any way affects her impartiality as a panel member."

'Robust processes'

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: "There are robust processes in place to ensure the Grenfell Tower Inquiry remains independent and that any potential conflicts of interest are properly considered and managed."

They added that the Arconic Foundation donated to a "specific scheme which provides mentoring for women in engineering and is unrelated to the issues being considered by the inquiry".

Downing Street said the prime minister "reaffirmed his commitment to getting to the truth of what happened, learn lessons and deliver justice for victims".

On Thursday's meeting with Grenfell families, a No 10 spokesman added: "During the meeting, they reflected on the phase one report of the Grenfell Inquiry, and looked ahead to the next stage."

Ms Mehra stepped in for the second phase of the inquiry after Prof Nabeel Hamdi, a housing expert, decided to quit because of the commitment involved in taking part in the inquiry.

The second phase of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry begins on 27 January.

After considering the night of the fire, during the first phase, the focus will switch to the refurbishment of the building and its role in the fire, as well as issues surrounding the building regulations.

The boss of Ryanair has threatened legal action over the government help given to regional carrier Flybe.

Michael O'Leary has written a strongly-worded letter to the Chancellor, Sajid Javid, saying the state rescue of Flybe contravenes competition rules.

He argues measures that are being put in place to help Flybe should be extended to other airlines.

If they are not, Ryanair intends to launch legal proceedings against the government, Mr O'Leary said.

British Airways' owner IAG has already filed a complaint with the EU, arguing the rescue breaches state aid rules.

Earlier this week, the government approved help for Flybe, which is thought to centre on giving the airline extra time to pay about &#163;100m of outstanding Air Passenger Duty (APD).

Details of the rescue plan have not been made public, however the government has said it is fully compliant with state aid rules.

Mr O'Leary's letter describes the rescue as a "badly thought-out bailout of a chronically loss-making airline" and calls for any tax holiday granted to Flybe to be extended to rival operators.

"Unlike Flybe we all operate profitable business models (without the benefit of being owned by billionaires)" the letter says "We must be treated the same as Flybe if fair competition is to exist."

Flybe's owners include Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital who have agreed to invest &#163;30m into the airline.

Stobart Group said it will provide &#163;9m of capital "with the funds drawn down only if required".

HMRC has indicated in a tweet that what is being described as a "tax holiday" for Flybe is available to other businesses that run into trouble.

"Time to Pay agreements are common where taxes or duties are owed," it said. HMRC said last year more than 700,000 such arrangements were used.

'Lack of transparency'

Ryanair's letter said that the government should clarify what support is being given to Flybe including details of any "APD holiday".

"Should you fail to confirm these facts within the next seven-day period, please be advised that Ryanair intends to launch proceedings against your government for breach of UK and EU competition law and breach state aid rules," the letter said.

IAG has also written to the government accusing it of a "lack of transparency" and has submitted a Freedom of Information request over the details of the rescue.

The government has said it will review APD as part of a government commitment to improving regional connectivity across the UK. It intends to make a further announcement at the Budget in March.

A rail industry body and environmental lobby groups have voiced concern that cutting taxes on flying provided the wrong incentives at a time when the government is also aiming to cut carbon emissions in order to tackle the climate crisis.

The Department for Transport said the outcome would "benefit the entire industry".</text><tags>HM Revenue &amp; Customs, Companies, Ryanair, Flybe</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50688975<category>uk</category><title>Reynhard Sinaga: How the Manchester rapist found his victims</title><text>Image copyright Facebook

Warning: This piece contains accounts of sexual assaults

Reynhard Sinaga is thought to be the UK's "most prolific rapist" ever. For several years, until he was caught in 2017, he preyed on young men enjoying a night out.

Princess Street, in the heart of Manchester's city centre, is rarely quiet.

If you follow it down from the impressive Victorian town hall on Albert Square, past bars, shops, restaurants, and converted textile warehouses, you reach the borders of two of the city's most popular destinations - Chinatown and the Gay Village.

Beyond that, you come to a stretch of road bordered by nightclubs - Factory, Fifth, Joshua Brooks - a big part of the city's vibrant nightlife.

With its close proximity to two of the city's universities, the road is also a popular area for student accommodation.

Reynhard Sinaga, a 36-year-old postgraduate student, had made this his home for more than seven years, living in a rented flat just a few moments' walk from Factory Nightclub.

Sinaga, originally from Indonesia, was a perpetual student. He already had four degrees and was studying for a doctorate. By night he was a serial sex offender.

He has been found guilty of drugging, raping and sexually assaulting 48 men, but police believe they are among at least 190 victims.

They are able to be so precise about these numbers because Sinaga filmed his attacks and collected what detectives call "trophies" - items or information stolen from his victims.

Sinaga typically approached his victims in the street. The rapist operated in a small area surrounding his flat. His targets were men mostly in their late teens or early 20s who had been out drinking, often in the nearby nightclubs.

Some were on their way home, others had become separated from friends.

Many were too drunk to remember their conversation with Sinaga, but for those who did there was no indication of a sexual motive. Sinaga used various pretexts to entice each to his flat.

Some victims could recall being provided with a drink and then blacking out.

Are you affected by this?

BBC Action Line has support and more information on emotional distress

Greater Manchester Police said anyone who believes they might have been attacked by Sinaga can report information online or call its police line on 0800 092 0410 from inside the UK or 0207 158 0124 from abroad.

The force said anyone in need of support from specialist agencies could call 0800 056 0154 from within the UK or 0207 158 0011 from abroad.

Sinaga presented himself as a flamboyant, churchgoing academic who used the nickname "posh spice". A thin man of slight build and short stature, physically he appeared unthreatening. Several victims recall him smiling a lot.

It was this apparent harmlessness that enabled Sinaga to pose as a "good Samaritan", coaxing men he approached back to the flat.

We know about the benign impression Sinaga created because dozens of victims gave testimony to police, with 48 of them appearing in court over the course of four trials.

Of the victims who went to court, the vast majority were heterosexual. Ian Rushton, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said he thought Sinaga took "a particular pleasure in preying on heterosexual men".

Most of his victims were living in Manchester at the time and, in all, 26 were students when they were attacked.

Their accounts explain how Sinaga operated.

One was waiting for his girlfriend outside Fifth Avenue nightclub - since renamed Fifth Manchester - when he was approached by a "small Asian guy" who seemed harmless.

The man was invited back to Sinaga's flat to wait for his girlfriend, but recalled nothing further after being given a shot of clear liquid to drink.

Another man described being "approached by a young Asian gentleman". He said he had a "vague recollection of explaining that my phone was dead and that I was trying to get a taxi but the taxis were passing me".

He added: "I think I can recall a conversation along the lines of, 'Would you like to come inside and charge your phone and have a quick chat,'" he told the court.

To him, Sinaga "didn't seem like an imposing character" and during their conversations in the apartment, he appeared to be "an honest, motivated person" with an interest in academic research.

The man told the court that soon after being offered a drink, he couldn't remember "a single thing until the next morning".

After waking, confused and disoriented, he left within five minutes.

Like almost every victim, he had no idea he had been raped until being approached by police.

Another victim remembered his friends putting him in a cab outside a club. His next recollection was waking up in a strange apartment.

When he asked Sinaga what had happened, he described providing care and shelter after finding him lying in the street.

Another victim believed Sinaga had been "really nice and had looked after him".

One victim, a teenage university student, managed to get Sinaga's mobile number as a precaution after waking up in the flat, and then having concerns that something might have been stolen from him.

When he rang to ask for more information about what happened, Sinaga described himself as a "good Samaritan" who had found him unconscious on the pavement.

Another man remembered waking up on the floor, covered in a blanket, before thanking the flat's occupier for letting him stay over.

He suspected nothing, even though the person "refused to give me personal details" in order to assist with an insurance claim for a lost mobile phone.

The phone, like many others stolen from their owners, was later recovered from Sinaga's home by police.

Some victims felt incredibly unwell after regaining consciousness, sometimes naked and covered in vomit.

Unknown to them at the time, Sinaga had given his victims a drug - almost certainly GHB - which rendered them unconscious before he assaulted them.

What is GHB?

Class C prohibited drug - colourless and odourless liquid or powder, usually dissolved in water

Generates feelings of euphoria in very small doses; in only slightly larger amounts can cause unconsciousness and death

Used by clubbers and in so-called "chemsex"; also frequently implicated in sexual offences

Thought to account for thousands of hospital admissions each year, but statistics on its misuse remain sketchy

Between 2007 and 2017 more than 200 deaths were linked to the drug; since 2014 it has been named as a murder weapon in five cases

Closely related to GBL, a colourless liquid that sold is an industrial cleaner and converts to GHB in the body. GBL is only classed as Class C prohibited drug when knowingly intended for human consumption

One victim, who woke up naked on Sinaga's floor feeling nauseous and panic-stricken, came to the conclusion he had been drugged, telling his fianc&#233; about that suspicion but not about the condition in which he awoke.

Another man, who was told he could sleep on the floor, recalled waking twice during the night, on one occasion to be sick.

He remembered that on one of the occasions he was unable to move his arms and could feel himself being penetrated, before passing out again.

In the morning, he briefly spoke with Sinaga before leaving. He did not report what happened to police, until being approached by them.

It was the largest rape investigation in UK history.

Police found more than 100 of the men from clues in Sinaga's flat. But the identities of 70 men have not been established and police are now appealing for anyone who believes they may been abused by Sinaga to come forward.

The CPS's Ian Rushton says that Sinaga is probably the most prolific known rapist "anywhere in the world".

Image caption Depok, Indonesia

One of four children, Sinaga comes from a wealthy Indonesian family who live in Depok, a city within the Jakarta metropolitan area. His father is a banker and also a prominent businessman in the palm oil sector.

After obtaining a degree in architecture at the University of Indonesia in Depok, he moved to the UK in 2007 to study urban planning at the University of Manchester.

He went on to gain three degrees there before embarking on a doctorate in human geography at the University of Leeds - travelling there from Manchester when required.

His family wealth meant that he rarely worked, although he claims to have had stints in employment in hospitality at both Manchester football clubs and in a clothes shop. Manchester United have since said they have no record of him working at the club. He worked for a period at a bar in the city's Gay Village, the area where he spent much of his time socialising. He was also a regular at a local church.

After originally living in student accommodation, Sinaga moved to a rented flat in Montana House on Princess Street in 2011.

While his convictions cover a period of two and a half years, police believe his offences predate 2015. But they say they may never know the true extent of his crimes.

It came to an end in the summer of 2017.

Sinaga was offending with abandon, sometimes night after night. In footage recovered from CCTV cameras covering his block of flats, he is seen leaving one evening only to return with a man 60 seconds later.

It was just after midnight on 2 June 2017, when he approached his final victim.

A teenager, who left The Factory nightclub to get some fresh air after becoming separated from friends, agreed to go to Sinaga's flat after it was suggested he could try to contact them from there.

The man recalled nothing further until waking several hours later being sexually attacked by Sinaga.

He immediately pushed Sinaga away, who responded by screaming "intruder" and "help", before repeatedly biting the teenager.

The man hit Sinaga several times, escaped from the flat, and then called police, who arrived to a chaotic scene.

Sinaga, who was discovered semi-conscious with serious injuries, was at first viewed sympathetically, and the teenager was arrested for assault.

But Sinaga's behaviour in hospital began to arouse suspicion. He kept asking officers to have a mobile phone brought to him from his flat.

Police asked him to confirm the pin number before they would hand it over. However Sinaga gave a series of false numbers, then tried to grab the phone after providing the correct one.

The officer became so suspicious that he seized the phone as potential evidence and, when it was checked, a video recording was found of Sinaga raping the arrested teenager.

It was the start of what the officer overseeing the investigation, Assistant Chief Constable Mabs Hussain, calls "an absolutely unprecedented case".

He says the inquiry has been like "piecing a jigsaw together without the picture".

Another of Sinaga's mobiles had somehow ended up in the pocket of the final victim.

Between them, the two phones had been used to capture about 800 videos of Sinaga raping or sexually assaulting unconscious men.

The victims, usually snoring loudly, were often repeatedly raped over several hours.

Image copyright Google Street View

In some of the films, Sinaga is seen to forcibly hold men down who, though unconscious, were visibly distressed or made attempts to push him away. In others, victims are seen to vomit while being attacked.

To find the men, detectives used both the films and "trophies" collected by Sinaga - phones, watches, ID cards from their wallets, images that Sinaga had downloaded from their social media profiles, searches about them he conducted online.

When they lacked identifying information, investigators tried facial recognition technology, approached local universities, and asked other police forces around the UK if they knew any of the men.

Officers also considered whether Sinaga might have killed any of his victims with fatal drug overdoses, examining potential links to unsolved deaths or missing people, but there was no evidence to suggest this was the case.

When officers made a positive identification, that person would be approached and told he had been a victim of sexual offences.

Lisa Waters, of the St Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre, says their crisis workers accompanied detectives on these visits in order to "offer immediate emotional and practical support".

She says that being told what happened "can be quite overwhelming, very confusing".

"What we didn't want to do was to drop the bombshell and then just disappear and leave these men with no support," she says.

A large programme was put in place to provide ongoing support.

Waters says many of the men have chosen not to tell anybody else about what happened to them.

"That might be because they might want to protect their own psychological health; it might be because they're ashamed to tell other people; it might be because they're fearful of other people's responses," she says.

Dozens of those approached did not want to go through the court process.

Sinaga was found to have told unsuspecting friends about some of the rapes, passing them off as consensual sexual conquests.

In messages about the first victim who went to court, Sinaga boasted about the attack on New Year's Eve in 2014.

"I didn't get my new year kiss, but I've had my first sex in 2015 already," he wrote, adding that the man was "straight in 2014. 2015 is his breakthrough to the gay world hahaha".

During another boast about what he presented as his prowess with "straight" men, Sinaga wrote: "Take a sip of my secret poison, I'll make you fall in love."

Police officers have spoken to other men, tracked down as a result of still images discovered in the flat that date from before 2015. These men recall being there, but not what happened. There is no other evidence available to show that they were sexually assaulted.

Only one previous report to police was linked to Sinaga after his arrest, dating from April 2017, when the victim had woken disorientated and unwell in a strange room with an Asian male.

He quickly left, but later that day had flashbacks of being sexually assaulted and - two days afterwards - he called the police.

However, the man was unsure of the property in which he had been assaulted, meaning inquiries focused on two nearby hotels, neither of which had had any guests who matched the suspect's description.

Despite the overwhelming evidence, Sinaga pleaded not guilty to all 159 charges, forcing a series of four trials in which his victims had to give evidence and jurors had to watch hours of distressing videos.

Court rules meant that nothing could be reported in the media and each jury was unaware of the wider case against him.

Sinaga gave evidence in the first and last of the trials, running what the judge called a "ludicrous defence" which involved him claiming that each victim had agreed to fulfil his "sexual fantasy" by being penetrated while being filmed and pretending to be asleep.

When this scenario was suggested to one victim in court, he responded by saying it was "absolutely farcical".

Sinaga changed his story during the trials.

In the first trial, he denied that the loud snoring heard in some films was snoring at all, insisting it was just "breathing sounds".

But, by the time of the final trial, he claimed the snoring was actually just "role-play".

It was only halfway through the first trial that he admitted penetrating most of the victims on that indictment.

In the witness box he came across as vain and self-absorbed, telling jurors: "I make myself available all the time&#8230; I may look like a 'lady boy' and it seems very popular amongst curious men who are looking for a gay experience."

When entering and exiting court he often appeared cheerful, as if he was enjoying the process.

In the absence of the jury, the judge repeatedly asked defence counsel whether any of the evidence could be agreed, to spare jurors watching every video.

But Sinaga would not agree and, because he insisted each victim was conscious and consenting, the videos had to be played to demonstrate this was a lie.

The prosecution case was that Sinaga used the drug GHB to incapacitate his victims.

No trace of the drug was found in his apartment and - due to the circumstances of Sinaga's arrest - the final victim was not tested quickly enough for its presence to be established.

However, the symptoms shown by the hundreds of videos were all consistent with GHB intoxication, as were the descriptions of him providing clear liquid shots, and each trial heard expert evidence about its effects.

GHB was used by Stephen Port, who murdered four men between June 2014 and September 2015. The men were given fatal overdoses of the drug. Port was also convicted of raping or assaulting several living victims using GHB.

The impact on Sinaga's victims is vast.

Waters says that "some of the men have found it very difficult to function in everyday life".

This has resulted in substance misuse, people unable to go to work, students unable to finish university, and others having to leave home after feeling unable to function any longer within their families.

She adds that "some men have been suicidal and we've had to try to help them come to terms with that and how we can make them safe".

Dr Sam Warner, author of a report about the psychological impact on Sinaga's victims, says a loss of power coupled with an absence of memory can be "extremely frightening, disturbing, upsetting because that goes to the heart of how you make sense of yourself, how you understand your experiences".

"In a situation where people have been incapacitated through drugs they may have no flashback to that particular event," she says.

"What they will have is the flashback to being told, however sensitively done, because suddenly they become a rape victim at that point."

She says the stress and trauma "may continue throughout people's lives".

In a series of statements read in court, the men themselves described the impact.

"I felt numb. I was totally shocked, embarrassed, betrayed and very angry," one said.

"His actions were disgusting, unforgiveable. He has massively abused my trust in humanity."

Another man said: "I want Sinaga to spend the rest of his life in prison. Not only for what he has done to me but for what he has done to the other lads and the misery and stress he has caused them."

A further victim said: "I remember the day the police contacted me, it is a day I will never forget because it changed my life forever."

Another: "I wish the worse for him, I want him to feel the pain and sufferance I have felt. He has destroyed a part of my life."

Throughout all four trials, Sinaga displayed not a glimmer of empathy or contrition.

His persistent smile, so often used to comfort and disarm, was instead revealed to be a mark of his cruelty.

In a message to Sinaga, one victim said: "I'm not going to let you ruin my life."</text><tags>Reynhard Sinaga</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/51140189<category>sport</category><title>Mbwana Samatta: Aston Villa hoping to sign Genk striker for &#163;10m</title><text>Mbwana Samatta has scored 43 league goals in 98 appearances for Genk in Belgium's top flight.

Aston Villa are hoping to complete a &#163;10m deal for Genk striker Mbwana Samatta as manager Dean Smith moves to strengthen his attacking options.

Smith needs to bolster this area after losing Brazilian forward Wesley for the rest of the season with a knee injury sustained at Burnley on New Year's Day.

Samatta, who scored against Liverpool in this season's Champions League group stage, has emerged as a Villa target.

But the fine details of the transfer are yet to be agreed.

The 27-year-old Tanzania international requires a work permit so he will not be available in time for Villa's visit to Brighton on Saturday.

Villa's Jonathan Kodjia appears set for a move to Qatar after Al Gharafa claimed the striker was scheduled to arrive for a medical.

The 30-year-old Ivory Coast international, out of contract at the end of the season, has made just nine appearances in the current campaign, with his only two goals coming against an under-strength Liverpool side in December's Carabao Cup quarter-final.

Villa, 18th in the Premier League after 22 matches, have also been linked with 31-year-old Leicester City striker Islam Slimani.

The Algeria international is currently on loan at Monaco, and Smith said the club may have to take some gambles this month.

"January is even harder without recognised strikers as clubs can stick prices up a bit, it always has been a tough window and we have to take a couple of risks," said Smith.

"I'm calm and confident we will get players but we have big games and, if we don't get one in by Saturday, it'll be the third in row without a recognised striker.

"We have to make sure we do the best we can without and hope we can get one through.

"There is a necessity there. With Wesley getting injured and Keinan [Davis] being out we have to strengthen massively so we are looking for a couple."</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50578234<category>business</category><title>The man who got rich on data - years before Google</title><text>Amazon, Alphabet, Alibaba, Facebook, Tencent - five of the world's 10 most valuable companies, all less than 25 years old - and all got rich, in their own ways, on data.

No wonder it's become common to call data the "new oil". As recently as 2011, five of the top 10 were oil companies. Now, only ExxonMobil clings on.

The analogy isn't perfect. Data can be used many times, oil only once.

But data is like oil in that the crude, unrefined stuff is not much use to anyone.

You have to process it to get something valuable. You refine oil to make diesel, to put it in an engine.

With data, you need to analyse it to provide insights that can inform decisions - which advert to insert in a social media timeline, which search result to put at the top of the page.

Imagine you were asked to make just one of those decisions.

Someone is watching a video on YouTube, which is run by Google, which is owned by Alphabet. What should the system suggest they watch next? Pique their interest, and YouTube gets to serve them another advert. Lose their attention, and they will click away.

You have all the data you need. Consider every other YouTube video they have ever watched - what are they interested in? Now, look at what other users have gone on to watch after this video.

Weigh up the options, calculate probabilities. If you choose wisely, and they view another ad, well done - you've earned Alphabet all of, ooh, maybe 20 cents (15p).

Clearly, relying on humans to process data would be impossibly inefficient. These business models need machines.

In the data economy, power comes not from data alone but from the interplay of data and algorithm.

50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.

It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.

In the 1880s, a young German-American inventor tried to interest his family in a machine to process data more quickly than humans could manage.

Herman Hollerith had designed the machine but needed money to test it.

Picture something that looks a bit like an upright piano but instead of keys, it has a slot for cards, about the size of a dollar bill, with holes punched in them.

Facing you are 40 dials, which may or may not tick upwards after you insert each new card.

Herman Hollerith's family didn't get it. Far from rushing to invest, they laughed at him. Hollerith evidently did not forgive - he cut them off. His children were to grow up with no idea they had relatives on their father's side.

Hollerith's invention responded to a very specific problem. Every 10 years, the US government conducted a census. That was nothing new. Governments through the ages have wanted to know who lives where and who owns what, to help raise taxes and find conscripts.

But if you're going to send a small army of enumerators around the country, it must be tempting to ask about an ever wider range of things. What jobs do people do? Any illnesses or disabilities? What languages do they speak?

Knowledge is power, as 19th Century bureaucrats understood just as well as 21st Century platform companies.

Yet with the 1880 census, the bureaucrats had swallowed more data than they could digest.

The census had been expanding to include libraries, nursing homes, crime statistics and many other topics. In 1870, the census had five different kinds of questionnaire. In 1880, it had 215.

It soon became clear adding up the answers would take years - they'd barely have finished this census when it would be time to start the next one.

A lucrative government contract surely awaited anyone who could speed the process up.

Young Herman had worked on the 1880 census, so he understood the problem.

He had decided to seek his fortune by inventing a new kind of brake for trains. As it happened, a train journey helped him to solve the census problem instead.

Rail tickets were often stolen. So railway companies found an ingenious way to link them to the person who'd bought them: a "punch photograph".

Conductors used a hole-punch to select from a range of physical descriptors - as Hollerith recalled: "Light hair, dark eyes, large nose et cetera." If a dark-haired, small-nosed scoundrel stole your ticket, he wouldn't get far.

And after observing this system, Hollerith realised people's answers to census questions could also be represented as holes in cards.

That could solve the problem, because punched cards had been used to control machines since the early 1800s - the Jacquard loom wove patterned fabric based on them.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Weaver and inventor Joseph Marie Jacquard demonstrating his loom complete with punched cards containing the pattern instructions

All Hollerith needed to do was make a "tabulating machine" to add up the census punch cards he envisaged.

In that piano-like contraption, a set of spring-loaded pins descended on the card; where they found a hole, they completed an electrical circuit, which moved the appropriate dial up by one.

Happily for Hollerith, the bureaucrats were more impressed than his family. They rented his machines to count the 1890 census, to which they'd added yet more questionnaires.

Compared with the old system, Hollerith's machines proved years quicker and millions of dollars cheaper.

More importantly, they made it easier to interrogate the data. Suppose you wanted to find people aged 40 to 45, married, and working as a carpenter. No need to sift through 200 tonnes of paperwork - just set up the machine and run the cards through it.

More things that made the modern economy:

Governments soon saw uses far beyond the census.

"Across the world," says historian Adam Tooze, "bureaucrats were inspired to dream of omniscience." America's first social security benefits were disbursed through punched cards in the 1930s.

The following decade, punched cards notoriously helped organise the Holocaust.

Businesses, too, were quick to see the potential. Insurers used punched cards for actuarial calculations, utilities for billing, railways for shipping, manufacturers to keep track of sales and costs.

Hollerith's Tabulating Machine Company did a roaring trade. You may have heard of the company that, through mergers, it eventually became: IBM.

It remained a market leader as punched cards gave way to magnetic storage, and tabulating machines to programmable computers. It was still on the list of the world's 10 biggest companies a few years ago.

But if the power of data was apparent to Hollerith's customers, why did the data economy take another century to arrive?

Image caption Voice-activated smart speakers capture ever greater amounts of data about us

Because there's something new about the kind of data that's now being compared to oil - the likes of Google and Amazon don't need an army of enumerators to collect it.

We trail it behind us every time we use our smartphones or ask Alexa to turn the light on.

This kind of data is not as neatly structured as the pre-defined answers to census questions precision-punched into Hollerith's cards. That makes it harder to make sense of. But there's unimaginably more of it.

And as algorithms improve, and more of our lives are lived online, that bureaucratic dream of omniscience is fast becoming corporate reality.

"I don't really want to shake your hand."

"You won't be getting any votes down here buddy... you're out."

"What about the people who are dead now, Mr Prime Minister? What about the people who have nowhere to live?"

As Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison toured a bushfire-ravaged town on Thursday, he was loudly heckled by locals. The anger towards him in Cobargo, New South Wales, was palpable. But most awkward - and attention-grabbing - were two quieter encounters.

In one, Mr Morrison approached a woman and asked "how are you?" When she failed to meet his hand, he reached down and lifted hers for a limp handshake.

She responded: "I'm only shaking your hand if you give more money to RFS [Rural Fire Service]. So many people have lost their homes."

"I understand," he replied. As he walked away, she added: "We need more help."

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Morrison was criticised online for lifting the woman's hand

After a firefighter separately refused to shake his hand, Mr Morrison said to his aides: "Tell that fella I'm really sorry, I'm sure he's just tired." A local official responded: "No, no, he lost a house."

The exchanges, all filmed and widely shared, have again focused public ire on Mr Morrison over his handling of an unprecedented bushfire crisis. The prime minister has faced persistent accusations of being too absent, including by taking a holiday to Hawaii, and underplaying the role of climate change.

Fires as big as small countries

Since September, blazes across Australia have killed 20 people, razed more than 1,200 homes and scorched millions of hectares. Though much attention has centred on worst-hit NSW, every state and territory has been affected.

Smoke has shrouded towns and cities in Australia's most populated south-east, bringing hazardous air quality to millions of people. Millions of animals are estimated to have perished, and the economic cost is predicted to be enormous.

Public gratitude has been boundless for the fatigued firefighters - overwhelmingly volunteers - who have battled blazes as big as small countries. Three have died on duty. Fire service chiefs, such as Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons in NSW, have often been the face of the crisis.

To critics of Mr Morrison, those chiefs have provided a stark contrast in leadership. On Friday, a high-profile member of Mr Morrison's own party made a withering critique.

"The only two people who are providing leadership at this stage are Shane Fitzsimmons and [NSW Premier] Gladys Berejiklian," Andrew Constance, the state transport minister, told Seven News.

Of the heckling, Mr Constance added: "To be honest, the locals probably gave him the welcome he probably deserved."

What has prompted the anger?

Early in the crisis, criticism centred on Mr Morrison's reluctance to discuss how climate change is exacerbating bushfires - a link acknowledged by Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.

Though he has since acknowledged it as a factor, the conservative leader maintains there is no direct link between the fires and his climate policies. This has continued to cause controversy because of Australia's reliance on coal mining.

But as the fires have spread, Mr Morrison has been accused of "going missing" in other ways. Most prominently, he took a holiday to Hawaii last month as many blazes intensified - prompting him to later apologise for causing "great anxiety" with his timing.

A New Year's Day cricket event, where he said Australians would soon be gathering round TV sets to be "inspired by the great feats of our cricketers", was accused of being "tone deaf".

Many have called on the government to better fund Australia's largely unpaid firefighting services, pointing to an extraordinary strain on resources, and arguing that smaller communities are being disadvantaged.

A group of ex-fire chiefs has argued a new long-term firefighting strategy is needed, but they have criticised Mr Morrison for refusing to meet them.

Mr Morrison found himself in even more hot water on Saturday when he tweeted a video, authorised by his Liberal Party, trumpeting the government's latest measures to tackle the fires.

To a backdrop of upbeat music, the video highlights the 3,000 defence force reservists called in, as well as extra water-bombing aircraft and other resources to bolster the operation.

The Liberal Party also tweeted the extra measures in an advert saying "our Defence Force is providing boots on the ground, planes in the sky and ships at sea, to support the bushfire fighting effort and recovery".

Mr Morrison's critics accused his government of using the bushfires - and the military - for political campaigning.

The Australia Defence Association lobby group said the Liberal Party advert was a "clear breach" of conventions aimed at keeping the military out of politics.

The association accused the party of "milking ADF support to civil agencies fighting bushfires".

Pat Conroy, shadow minister for international development, said Mr Morrison was trying to "exploit a national tragedy".

He described the advert as a "new low".

What does Morrison say?

After initially saying the firefighters "want to be there", the prime minister recently pledged compensation for volunteers who miss work to fight fires, and an additional A$11m (&#163;5.8m; $7.7m) for firefighting aircraft.

He has resisted calls for further funding, but frequently paid tribute to firefighters. He has emphasised a prolonged drought as a key reason for causing dry conditions which fuel fires.

When asked on Friday why he had been heckled, he told 3AW radio: "Because people are hurting and angry. Whether they are angry with me or angry about the situation, all I know is they're hurting."

He has maintained that Australia will meet its climate commitments - an assertion disputed by the UN and others - but that deeper action would not take precedence over "reckless" cuts to jobs in fossil fuel industries.

Mr Morrison has called on Australians not to panic and to pull together. He has repeatedly said it was up to each state to arrange their emergency response - the best tactic is to let them get on with their job, he has said.

His supporters say he can't be held responsible for the sort of natural disaster which has always struck Australia, nor fix it by knee-jerk policy U-turns.

Mr Morrison also hit back at the criticism of his tweeted video, saying: "The video message simply communicates the government's policy decisions and the actions the government is undertaking to the public."

'You will be judged'

Mr Morrison was returned last May in a surprise election victory that led many to hail him as a shrewd, instinctive politician. But for some, his bushfire response has stirred incredulity.

"You are watching the destruction of a political leader and this time not by his own party but by his own hand," tweeted one veteran commentator, Barrie Cassidy, after the Cobargo footage. Another, Ten's Hugh Riminton, wrote: "I have never seen a PM so openly disdained during a national disaster."

Not all have been been so critical. Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews, a Labor politician, thanked Mr Morrison for providing assistance as bushfires swept through the state this week. Liz Innes, a mayor of a shire near Cobargo, apologised to Mr Morrison for those who had heckled him, the ABC reported.

The federal Labor opposition, too, has often appeared reluctant to directly criticise Mr Morrison. It has also been accused of courting pro-coal voters in the wake of its election loss.

Australia was the fourth largest producer of coal in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency. It also has one of the highest per capita greenhouse gas emission rates globally. The 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last of 57 countries for its climate policy, saying it had gone backwards under the Morrison government.

Many including John Hewson, a former leader of Mr Morrison's Liberal Party, argue that the prime minister's "hang-ups on the climate issue" are holding him back on the fire crisis.

"The die is already cast on your government and, if you continue as you have been doing, time will not be your friend," Mr Hewson wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald.

It came out of nowhere. Even ministers in the Russian government apparently did not see their departure coming.

Was it a case of a new working year in Moscow - out with the old and in with the new?

But it was clear Vladimir Putin, 67, had change in mind. With four years to go before he leaves office, and 20 years already served, it was clear he was planning ahead.

A new government, led by Mikhail Mishustin, a technocrat who turned Russia's hated tax service into an efficient operation, and the end of a man who has worked hand in glove with Mr Putin since he became president.

Dmitry Medvedev even filled in as president for four years, because under the constitution Mr Putin could not.

Mr Medvedev, the unpopular head of the United Russia party, is not going away, but his new role as deputy head of Russia's security council is far more behind the scenes.

"It's a golden parachute. It means he is in reserve, as the security council is Putin's closest inner circle - his own mini-government," says Alexander Baunov of the Carnegie Moscow Center.

Mr Putin is coming to the same point he reached after his second term, when Dmitry Medvedev deputised for him. But this time the president will not take a false backseat as prime minister. It now appears that Mr Putin's fourth term as president will be his last.

So what does he want instead?

On the face of it, it means more powers for parliament - selecting the prime minister and approving the cabinet, for a start. But that won't happen yet. Mr Putin has chosen Mr Medvedev's successor and parliament will have to ratify him.

As for any further powers for parliament, that is still unclear. "They'll be the same MPs, not much will change," says Sergei Goryashko of BBC Russian.

What President Putin is suggesting is a public vote on changing the constitution - the first such vote since 1993.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Russians first got a sense of change in the air during Mr Putin's speech to both houses of parliament on Wednesday morning

One of the standout proposals is making the State Council a formal government agency enshrined in the constitution.

At the moment it is an advisory body packed with 85 regional governors and other officials including political party leaders. It is so large that when it meets it fills a hall in the Kremlin.

But Mr Putin clearly has designs on its future. One theory is that he could become a new, powerful leader of the State Council.

"The very fact he's started a discussion on the State Council is that he's maybe trying to create another place where power resides, where he can step above the presidential post," Mr Baunov suggests.

Mr Putin wants to remain in power, the question is how, says Sergei Goryashko. We are now almost sure he will not remain president after 2024, it is which role he chooses to fill. It could even be in his existing role as head of the security council.

Sam Greene, head of the Russia Institute at King's College London, believes that elites looking to secure their future after 2024 will "now have to play on at least three chess boards simultaneously" - defining the roles of the Duma (parliament), the State Council and Mr Putin himself.

Using a similar analogy, commentator Konstantin Eggert said it was the "same meaningless chess designed to imitate novelty" while ultimately preserving the status quo.

Skip Twitter post by @BBCSteveR My take on why the Russian government resigned...as they say over here, &#8220;Chort yevo znayet!&#8221; (&#8220;Devil only knows!&#8221;). But it feels like the first pieces of an important jigsaw have been put into place. And when it&#8217;s complete, it&#8217;ll show Putin still in power. &#8212; Steve Rosenberg (@BBCSteveR) January 15, 2020 Report

What reaction has there been?

For Alexei Navalny, the biggest opposition threat to President Putin, this marks a return to Soviet-style politics and any vote on changes to the constitution would be a fraud.

Fellow activist Lyubov Sobol was equally scathing: "Swapping some thieving guys for other thieving guys is neither reform nor regeneration."

Others compared the resignation of the widely unpopular Mr Medvedev to the fall of Mr Putin's earlier prime minister, Mikhail Fradkov, a year before the president's second term ended.

Although the new candidate is a respected technocrat who has reformed the tax service, he is little known. Mr Fradkov was also replaced by an unknown, Viktor Zubkov, who lasted only a few months in the job.</text><tags>Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, Vladimir Putin</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51107687<category>uk</category><title>Harry and Meghan: Your questions answered on tax, titles and trademarks</title><text>Image copyright Reuters

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex recently announced they would step back as senior royals.

Here we answer some of the questions we have received from readers about Prince Harry and Meghan's possible plans.

If Prince Harry and Meghan assume permanent residency in Canada, will they pay taxes? - Paul, Vancouver

The duke and duchess have said they do not have any special tax privileges, so it is likely the usual rules apply.

It's not clear how much time Prince Harry and Meghan intend to spend in Canada.

But if they seek permanent residency there, or they spend 183 days in a tax year in the country, then Canada will consider them resident for tax purposes.

Even if they spend less time abroad - perhaps so Meghan can continue to fulfil the requirements for British citizenship - they will be expected to pay tax on any income they earn from working in Canada.

How do Canadians feel about the monarchy? - Alex Bowers, Kent

The Queen is Canada's head of state. Recent polls have found Canadians leaning towards severing ties with the monarchy but some individual royals are still seen very favourably.

Image copyright Chris Jackson Image caption Prince Harry and Meghan enjoy a laugh at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto

A poll of 1,000 people last year by Research Co suggested 33% wanted an elected head of state, while 31% wanted to keep the monarchy.

Republican sentiment is more common in French-speaking Quebec, where 53% said they wanted a republic.

But Prince Harry himself has a 70% favourability rating in Canada, while for Meghan it is 60%.

If they drop their royal titles, can they one day regain them? - Sarah Coleman, Lancashire

The Queen made Prince Harry Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel on his wedding day, in May 2018. Meghan became the Duchess of Sussex.

If the couple were to drop their titles, Prince Harry would remain a prince, having been born one.

Only the monarch could restore any of their other titles.

How can they trademark the Sussex royal name? - Wendy Watkins, Herefordshire

Prince Harry and Meghan applied in June 2019 to trademark the "Sussex Royal" brand in the UK, for items including books, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social-care services.

Their application was published in December 2019.

If no-one objects, the trademark could be registered as early as February 2020.

They are also reportedly seeking to register the brand as a global trademark covering a wide range of goods and services including clothing, stationery and "emotional support" groups.

Do the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have an automatic right to reside in Canada? - Heather Love, Ballynure, County Antrim

The couple spent Christmas in Canada and Meghan recently returned to the country with her eight-month-old son, Archie.

As a Briton, the prince is entitled to spend up to six months a year as a visitor in Canada - anything longer than that and he would have to apply for a visa.

As an American citizen, the same rules apply for his wife.

The use of bailiffs to pursue drivers for unpaid parking fines has risen by 21% in two years in England and Wales, according to a debt charity.

Parking debts were passed from councils to enforcement agents on nearly 1.1 million occasions in 2018-19, analysis by the Money Advice Trust found.

Bailiffs were only called in more frequently by councils to collect unpaid council tax.

Local authorities said they had a duty to collect this money.

Bailiffs cannot force their way into people's homes, but they can take money on the doorstep, or possessions inside or outside a home to cover the cost of unpaid debts.

The Money Advice Trust, which runs the National Debtline, collected data from 367 local authorities and found that more than 2.6 million debts were referred to bailiffs.

Council tax accounted for the largest proportion of cases (54%) but the total of 1.4 million was unchanged from two years ago.

In contrast, the use of bailiffs to pursue parking fines has risen to now account for 41% of bailiff use by local authorities. For smaller councils, their use to collect unpaid fines from drivers had risen by 55% in four years, the analysis suggested.

When bailiffs are called in

Local authorities typically have their own traffic wardens - called civil enforcement officers - who issue penalty charge notices for parking on double yellow lines, in a permit-only zone, on zigzag lines, or in parking meter zones.

These parking penalty notices are not criminal offences. Drivers cannot be sent to prison for not paying. Instead, they are enforced through a county court.

Twenty-one days after a court order is issued, the local authority can issue a warrant to the bailiffs, which allows the bailiffs to act.

It is not possible to ask the court to suspend the warrant or to make an order to allow the charge to be paid in instalments.

The rules differ for council tax arrears, housing benefit overpayments and unpaid business rates.

The Money Advice Trust is calling on the government to change the rules to allow drivers who are struggling to pay a fine to offer it in instalments.

"Bailiff action should only ever be used as a last resort and can be avoided," said Joanna Elson, chief executive of the trust.

"We will continue to work constructively with councils to help them reduce their bailiff use - and to impress on central government the urgent need for the national policy changes that are required to quicken the pace of change."

Richard Watts, from the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said: "Councils have a duty to their residents to collect taxes, which play a vital role in funding important services that people rely on."

Russell Hamblin-Boone, chief executive of the Civil Enforcement Association, said: "Enforcement action is an option used by local authorities to recover over &#163;500m of unpaid taxes and fines recovered each year, at no cost to the public bodies, which funds local services from adult social care and children's services, to refuse collections and road repairs."

The Ministry of Justice is reviewing whether bailiffs should be independently regulated.</text><tags>Personal finance, Parking, Motoring, Personal debt, Money</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/51143657<category>sport</category><title>Saracens face Premiership relegation if found to have breached salary cap again</title><text>Saracens remain bottom of the Premiership on minus seven points after eight games

Saracens are facing relegation from the Premiership if they are found to have breached the salary cap again.

The defending champions received a 35-point deduction and a &#163;5.3m fine in November, having broken the cap for the past three seasons.

However, there is widespread belief they will once more struggle to get under the &#163;7m limit this campaign.

Saracens have been told to comply with the rules immediately or face relegation at the end of the season.

The bosses of the top-flight clubs met at a Premiership Rugby board meeting in London on Tuesday.

It was decided that unless Saracens could prove their compliance, they would face the unprecedented step of dropping into the second tier.

Although Saracens interim chief executive Edward Griffiths revealed to the BBC earlier this month that the club may need to trim their squad to fit under the cap, no players have yet been released.

The contract season has already run for seven months - since the start of July - with all the money paid to players who have featured for the club during that period counting towards the cap.

Furthermore, any money paid as compensation to players for cutting short contracts would also be included in the wage bill.

Meanwhile, Premiership Rugby announced last month a comprehensive review of the current salary cap regulations, conducted by former government minister Lord Myners.

Saracens have been contacted for comment.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50458312<category>business</category><title>The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why US garlic farmers like Trump's tariffs

US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.

The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.

"It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war," says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.

"When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive."

Image caption Mr Christopher says that thousands of jobs in the US domestic garlic industry are now protected

US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as "dumping".

The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US "at less than fair value".

As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.

Mr Christopher likened it to "playing whack-a-mole", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.

Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.

US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.

Image caption The US garlic industry is centred on the Californian city of Gilroy

"Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front," says Mr Christopher. "So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them."

Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.

Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.

"We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic," he says. "It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line."

To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.

For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (&#163;19 and &#163;23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.

Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.

Image copyright Vessey &amp; Co Image caption Californian farming business Vessey &amp; Co closed its garlic division after growing it alongside cabbage and cauliflower for 100 years

Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey &amp; Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.

"Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me," he says.

"There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings."

For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.

Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.

"Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts," adds Mr Vessey. "But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business."

Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.

"They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure," he says.

"The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them."

Image caption Higher garlic prices are now being passed onto consumers, but Mr Christopher says the US industry needed help

Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs "are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game."

He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.

"It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry," says Mr Christopher.

Global Trade

More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:

However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.

"If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition," says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.

"But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run."

Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is "not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief".</text><tags>Trump tariffs, China economy, US economy, Global trade</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51069958<category>world</category><title>Building collapse misses pedestrians by seconds</title><text>US toddler unfazed by hungry lion

Joao Lourenco has a huge challenge ahead, as he becomes Angola's first new president in 38 years.

The ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) has won a huge majority in parliament following the 23 August election, according to official results, meaning he will succeed Jose Eduardo Dos Santos.

Under Mr Dos Santos, there was one golden rule for anyone who wanted to survive politically in Angola: Do not make your ambitions known.

President Dos Santos remained in charge by making sure that any potential challenger was quickly sidelined.

Joao Lourenco, 63, known as JLo, who was born to a family involved in anti-colonial politics, learnt that lesson the hard way.

In 1998, the liberation war veteran and Angolan Armed Forces general was elected MPLA secretary-general - a sign that his political fortunes were on the rise.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Joao Lourenco (r) had to wait nearly 15 years for President Dos Santos' blessing

Three years later, when President Dos Santos hinted that he might be ready to resign the presidency, Mr Lourenco made known his interest in the top job.

But the MPLA victory, early in 2002, in a 27-year civil war against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita), served to relaunch Mr Dos Santos' presidency, and any talk of retirement was soon forgotten.

The following year at the 2003 MPLA party congress, Mr Lourenco was demoted.

In 2012, as Mr Dos Santos approached 70, the succession issue became more pressing.

When the president elevated his cousin, Manuel Vicente, to become vice-president, some foreign observers saw this as the anointing of Mr Vicente as a successor.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Angola Vice-President Manuel Vicente did not have the military pedigree to become president

However, Mr Lourenco, would have known better - that the MPLA would never endorse a political outsider like Mr Vicente as president, and that a man with no military pedigree was a risky choice in a country where the security forces lurk in the shadows of politics.

Mr Lourenco, on the other hand, could be confident that he himself had both the party and the military credentials, and that this was enough to earn forgiveness for his lack of caution a decade earlier.

Sure enough, his appointment as defence minister in 2014 signalled his rehabilitation.

And his election in 2016 as MPLA party vice-president left no doubt that he would succeed the by now ailing Mr Dos Santos.

But Mr Dos Santos's long-held suspicion of potential rivals has made it nearly impossible for Mr Lourenco, or anyone else, to show initiative or cultivate a following.

This makes it difficult to know what to expect from the next president of one of Africa's biggest oil producers.

Is Angola's Dos Santos really giving up power?

While Mr Lourenco is only 12 years younger than President Dos Santos, he has been forced in the past few months to reinvent himself as a bringer of generational change.

The man born in 1954, schooled in the military and in the mysteries of the political culture of the old MPLA, has suddenly discovered social media.

He rarely looks entirely comfortable in his Facebook photos, even when relaxing at home with his wife, the former government minister and World Bank official Ana Dias Lourenco.

Although not naturally charismatic, Mr Lourenco's down-to-earth image is in sharp contrast to the affected manners of the equally uncharismatic Mr Dos Santos.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Despite Angola's huge oil wealth, most people live beneath the poverty level

After the MPLA's final election rally, Mr Lourenco was filmed walking among the crowd, and showing young voters how to make their cross on a sample ballot paper.

Although the incident was choreographed for the TV cameras, Mr Lourenco displayed more of a common touch in one minute than his predecessor had managed in decades.

He looks set to take control of a state in which President Dos Santos' relatives and loyalists remain in key positions and Mr Dos Santos himself remains in the kingmaker role as MPLA chairman.

Mr Lourenco will, however, have the support of those who see the corruption of the Mr Dos Santos regime as a liability to the party's future.

The MPLA is under unprecedented pressure. During the post-2003 oil boom, the government did little to diversify the economy away from its reliance on oil.

Consequently the slump in the oil price since 2014 has led to a foreign currency squeeze, job losses and soaring food prices in a country where most people were already struggling to make ends meet.

Once he takes over as president, Mr Lourenco needs to consolidate an independent support base within the MPLA.

And the sooner Mr Dos Santos quits as party leader, the better for Mr Lourenco.

In the end, the health of Angola's long-time leader, who has been undergoing cancer treatment for at least a year, could prove crucial.</text><tags>Angola</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/av/tennis/51109260<category>sport</category><title>Weather forecast for Australian Open</title><text>BBC Weather presenter Simon King brings the forecast for Australia amid the ongoing bushfires in the country.

The female-only W Series will feature on the Formula 1 support-race bill for the first time this year.

Races at the United States and Mexican Grands Prix in 2020 will be the climax to the W Series' second season.

W Series advisory board chairman and ex-F1 driver David Coulthard said it is "a truly impressive development".

F1 managing director Ross Brawn said: "W Series has contributed significantly to increasing interest in the topic of diversity and inclusion in motorsport."

The move is a significant vote of confidence for the new series, which was set up in 2019 with the intention of raising the profile of motorsport among women and the ultimate ambition of helping find a female F1 driver.

The last woman to race in F1 was Italian Lella Lombardi, who scored half a point with a sixth-place finish in the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix.

Racing on an F1 weekend is likely to enhance the W Series' standing around the world and will bring it to the attention of many thousands more fans at the track - the races in Austin and Mexico City are among the best-attended on the F1 calendar.

Brawn added: "We are convinced that our sport must offer equal opportunities for men and women to compete together.

"It is no coincidence that improving the diversity of the F1 grid by supporting and promoting driver talent from under-represented backgrounds is one of our strategic objectives.

"The ability for the great crowds who traditionally attend the Austin and Mexico City Grands Prix to see these talented female drivers up close will definitely further raise the awareness of the importance of inclusion and diversity in motorsport."

W Series chief executive officer Catherine Bond Muir said: "We at W Series are absolutely delighted that, in only our second season, our championship has been welcomed by Formula 1, and we're utterly thrilled that the final two races of the 2020 W Series season will therefore take place as part of the Formula 1 platform.

"Interest in and enthusiasm for W Series was enormous in our first season, 2019, among media and fans alike, and the addition of two all-new W Series races on the Formula 1 platform will inevitably increase that enthusiasm and interest."

Coulthard - who won 13 grands prix for Williams and McLaren in a 14-year career and is now an analyst for Channel 4's F1 coverage among other business commitments - added: "The announcement demonstrates very clearly the extent to which W Series has quickly been widely accepted as part of the international motorsport calendar."

Jamie Chadwick, the 2019 W Series champion, won a place at the Williams F1 team as development driver with impressive performances in the opening races last year. She has retained that position for 2020, and is racing in the W Series again this year too.

The other six W Series events will support the DTM German Touring Car Championship, as last year.

Northern Ireland will be kept in an "austerity trap" unless the government's financial package is increased, the Stormont finance minister has said.

Conor Murphy claimed the &#163;1bn on offer does nothing to fix problems with health and education.

He earlier described the package as an "act of bad faith".

NI Secretary Julian Smith has rejected criticism of the financial package to underpin the deal to restore Stormont.

Mr Murphy said the government has "stepped back from its financial commitment" and that it "isn't acceptable".

"It wouldn't be acceptable if Sinn F&#233;in, the DUP or any of the other parties said: 'We've made a political agreement - we're not going to do that, so you'll just have to get on with it anyway'," he said.

"[The deal] does nothing to allow us to transform public services, it really keeps us in the austerity trap that we've been in for nine years.

'Executive parties united on this'

"There is an obligation on [the government] to live up to an agreement they made.

"The executive parties are united on this, they want to see this delivered."

Julian Smith said it was the "biggest injection of new money in Northern Ireland in well over a decade".

The Westminster government is to give the NI Executive an extra &#163;1bn to support the agreement.

A further &#163;1bn will be added to Stormont's budget as an automatic result of spending plans for the entire UK.

Image caption Julian Smith defended the offer on Thursday

It is part of the New Decade New Approach deal to restore Northern Ireland devolution.

Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, Mr Smith warned the Northern Ireland parties about the "stringent conditions attached" to the financial package and called for a transformation of how spending is controlled.

On Wednesday, Mr Murphy said the financial package "makes our [NI executive] job much more difficult".

"The bottom line is with this proposed package, our public services face a shortfall of at least &#163;1bn next year alone," he said.

Mr Smith expressed disappointment that politicians in Northern Ireland had already ruled out introducing water charges and other rates increases.

"Northern Ireland taxpayers deserve to know that their money is being used efficiently and effectively," he said.

The NI secretary of state faced criticism from opposition parties and NI MPs about the level of funding promised.

The honeymoon period after the New Decade, New Approach deal is definitely over now.

In fact, it has passed quicker than any of us might have expected.

Conor Murphy doesn't like the fact that the Northern Ireland Office has put any of the figures out there because I think he would have hoped, as would some of the other ministers in the new Executive, that this would all still be subject to negotiations.

Instead, Julian Smith published the financial package, saying it's a &#163;2bn package and that it's a brilliant one.

Others say, hang on, &#163;1bn of that will be coming anyway and there's only &#163;1bn attached to this particular deal.

That is not what the local politicians wanted.

The NI secretary of state faced criticism from opposition parties and NI MPs about the level of funding promised.

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said there was a gap between the commitments made by both governments and the financial package which needed to be addressed.

He also called for assurances over the funding for a medical school in Londonderry and to increase student numbers to create a "full size" university in the city.

The DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson also sought assurances that the outstanding money from his party's confidence and supply deal with the conservatives would be made available to the NI executive.

In response to concerns about the level of funding being provided, Mr Smith described the financial package as a "good start" and said the government would look positively at other challenges in future budgets.

He added that Northern Ireland already receives 20% more funding than any other part of the UK.

Mr Smith called on the executive ministers to set out their priorities on how best to spend the money now on offer.</text><tags>Stormont deal, UK economy, Stormont deal, Northern Ireland Assembly</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-49254555<category>uk</category><title>Parents' ashes lost in transit leading to airline apology</title><text>Image copyright RT&#201; Image caption Bob Gilmour and his wife Kristen Hynes spoke to RT&#201; News about the loss of his parents' ashes

An airline has apologised to a passenger after the ashes of both his late parents were lost in transit as he took a flight from Italy to Ireland.

Bob Gilmour, who lives in Tasmania, is due to scatter his parents' ashes during separate ceremonies in Northern Ireland and England this week.

The Gilmour family flew to Dublin with Aer Lingus on Saturday but their bags, containing the ashes, did not arrive.

Aer Lingus said on Tuesday night that the bags have now been found in Milan.

But during the three-day hunt for the missing luggage the family faced the prospect of attending funeral services without the ashes.

Return to Ballymena

Before their deaths, Mr Gilmour's parents had requested that their ashes be scattered in their respective birthplaces in the UK.

His father, Samuel Gilmour was originally from Ballymena, County Antrim, and his English mother, Marjorie, was from Birmingham.

The couple met in England during World War Two when they were both serving with the Royal Air Force (RAF).

They married and settled down in County Antrim, before emigrating to Australia in 1967 with their two sons.

Bob Gilmour, who spent the first 11 years of his life growing up in Northern Ireland, booked his father's memorial ceremony in Ballymena on Wednesday.

A cousin still living in the County Antrim town commissioned a plaque for the event, engraved with the words: "Samuel Gilmour, a Ballymena boy come home at last."

A ceremony to commemorate his mother is due to take place in England on Friday.

Speaking to the Irish Times earlier on Tuesday, Bob Gilmour said: "So I now have a funeral service to go to in Ulster tomorrow and a funeral service to go to in Birmingham on Friday, but we have no bodies."

Personal mementos

The ceremonies were arranged with UK relatives to coincide with a family trip to Europe, after Mr Gilmour's daughter was offered a place at a Milan ballet school.

The family flew from Milan to Dublin on Saturday, but when they arrived at the Aer Lingus luggage carousel, they found out all four of their bags were missing.

Image copyright RT&#201; Image caption The family arranged the memorials to coincide with a trip to Europe

Mr Gilmour's luggage contained not only the ashes but also personal mementos of his parents.

Initially, two of the bags were located and returned to the family, but they did not include the bag with the ashes.

'Regret'

Mr Gilmour described the airline's response to the incident as "less than useless".

In a statement on Tuesday night, an Aer Lingus spokeswoman said the missing baggage has been located in Milan Malpensa Airport.

"Regrettably, it was not loaded onto the Aer Lingus flight by the baggage handlers at Malpensa Airport.

"The baggage will now arrive overnight into Dublin Airport where it will be immediately transported to the family. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused."</text><tags>Ballymena, Birmingham, Dublin, Aer Lingus</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49252501<category>technology</category><title>Black Hat: GDPR privacy law exploited to reveal personal data</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption GDPR is supposed to protect personal data, but this experiment used the law to help achieve the opposite effect

About one in four companies revealed personal information to a woman's partner, who had made a bogus demand for the data by citing an EU privacy law.

The security expert contacted dozens of UK and US-based firms to test how they would handle a "right of access" request made in someone else's name.

In each case, he asked for all the data that they held on his fiancee.

In one case, the response included the results of a criminal activity check.

Other replies included credit card information, travel details, account logins and passwords, and the target's full US social security number.

University of Oxford-based researcher James Pavur has presented his findings at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas.

It is one of the first tests of its kind to exploit the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May 2018. The law shortened the time organisations had to respond to data requests, added new types of information they have to provide, and increased the potential penalty for non-compliance.

"Generally if it was an extremely large company - especially tech ones - they tended to do really well," he told the BBC.

"Small companies tended to ignore me.

"But the kind of mid-sized businesses that knew about GDPR, but maybe didn't have much of a specialised process [to handle requests], failed."

He declined to identify the organisations that had mishandled the requests, but said they had included:

a UK hotel chain that shared a complete record of his partner's overnight stays

two UK rail companies that provided records of all the journeys she had taken with them over several years

a US-based educational company that handed over her high school grades, mother's maiden name and the results of a criminal background check survey

Mr Pavur has, however, named some of the companies that he said had performed well.

Image copyright James Pavur Image caption Mr Pavur says he believes he did not break the law himself while conducting the trial

He said they included:

the supermarket Tesco, which had demanded a photo ID

the domestic retail chain Bed Bath and Beyond, which had insisted on a telephone interview

American Airlines, which had spotted that he had uploaded a blank image to the passport field of its online form

One independent expert said the findings were a "real concern".

"Sending someone's personal information to the wrong person is as much a data breach as leaving an unencrypted USB drive lying around, or forgetting to shred confidential papers," said Dr Steven Murdoch, from University College London.

Time limit

Mr Pavur's bride-to-be gave him permission to carry out the tests and helped write up the findings, but otherwise did not participate in the operation.

So for correspondence, the researcher created a fake email address for his partner, in the format "first name-middle initial-last name@gmail.com".

An accompanying letter said that under GDPR, the recipient had one month to respond.

It added that he could provide additional identity documents via a "secure online portal" if required. This was a deliberate deception since he believed many businesses lacked such a facility and would not have time to create one.

The attacks were carried out in two waves.

For the first half of those contacted, he used only the information detailed above. But for the second batch, he drew on personal details revealed by the first group to answer follow-up questions.

The idea, he said, was to replicate the kind of attack that could be carried out by someone starting with just the details found on a basic LinkedIn page or other online public profile.

Fake postmarks

If the organisation asked for a "strong" type of ID - such as a passport or driver's licence scan - Mr Pavur declined.

He also decided not to create forgeries of more easily faked documents.

So, for example, he would not sign documents saying he was the data subject. Nor would he send emails with spoofed headers when asked to write from the victim's registered account.

But he did try to convince the companies to accept documents that would theoretically be easy to mock up, but in this case could be sourced from his fiancee.

So, when one train operator asked for a photocopy of a passport, he convinced it instead to accept a postmarked envelope addressed to the "victim".

In another case, a cyber-security company agreed to accept a photograph of a bank statement, which had been blacked out so that the only information left on view was the target's name and address.

Image copyright James Pavur Image caption Mr Pavur says that in one case he a heavily redacted bank statement was accepted

Sometimes such subterfuge was unnecessary.

One online gaming company asked for the applicant's account password. But on being told that it had been forgotten, Mr Pavur said it disclosed his fiancee's personal data anyway without asking for alternative verification.

Exposed passwords

Mr Pavur said that a total of 60 distinct pieces of personal information about his girlfriend were ultimately exposed.

These included a list of past purchases, 10 digits of her credit card number, its expiry date and issuer, and her past and present addresses.

In addition, one threat intelligence firm provided a record of breached usernames and passwords it held on his partner. These still worked on at least 10 online services as she had used the same logins for multiple sites.

In one case, the GDPR request letter was posted to the internet after being sent to an advertising company, constituting a data breach in itself. It contained the fiancee's name, address, email and phone number.

"Luckily it only had very simple data," said Mr Pavur.

"But you could imagine someone sending a letter with more detailed information."

Overall, of the 83 firms known to have held data about his partner, Mr Pavur said:</text><tags>Las Vegas, Cyber-security, GDPR, University of Oxford</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51047006<category>world</category><title>Iran plane crash: What we know about flight PS752</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Footage appears to show missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran

A Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) flight crashed shortly after taking off from the Iranian capital Tehran on 8 January, killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board.

It came in the midst of escalating tensions between the US and Iran.

After days of denial - and mounting evidence - on Saturday Iran admitted it had shot the Boeing plane down "unintentionally".

Here is what we know.

What happened?

On 8 January, at 06:12 local time (02:42 GMT), UIA flight PS752 took off from Imam Khomeini International Airport.

The plane was a Boeing 737-800 - one of the international airline industry's most widely used aircraft models.

Before it had left the airport's air space, the plane appeared to turn around to return to the runway. Shortly afterwards, it crashed.

The aircraft's "black boxes", which record flight data and sound within the cockpit, were recovered from the wreckage.

But there have also been reports that mechanical diggers were sent to the crash site before international investigators had arrived, prompting speculation that evidence was being destroyed.

What caused the crash?

The government in Tehran initially said the UIA plane suffered a technical problem shortly after take-off. It cited witnesses including the crew of another passenger plane who said it was on fire prior to impact.

Authorities said they lost radar contact when the plane was at an altitude of about 8,000ft (2,400m), minutes after taking off.

No radio distress call was made by the pilot, the report said.

However, the timing of the accident - just hours after Iran had launched missiles at US targets in Iraq - provoked speculation about other possible causes.

Aviation experts were quick to cast doubt on claims in Iranian state media that the crash was likely to have been caused by an engine fire.

Commercial aircraft are designed to be able to withstand - in general - a failed engine and to land safely.

On Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said evidence suggested an Iranian missile brought down the aircraft by accident.

"We have intelligence from multiple sources, including our allies and our own intelligence," Mr Trudeau told a news conference in Ottawa. "The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile. This may well have been unintentional."

He was echoing earlier reports in US media which said Pentagon officials were confident that the aircraft was shot down.

And evidence was beginning to back up the missile-shooting theory.

Video on social media showed a missile streaking across the night sky and exploding near the plane. (The New York Times later published a video that appeared to show two missiles targeting the airliner. It's thought the initial strike disabled the plane's transponder before the second strike around 23 seconds later. )

Three days after the accident, a statement by Iran's military was read on state TV and said the plane was brought down "unintentionally".

Have the Iranians explained everything?

There is general Iranian admission of guilt, but conflicting explanations about the exact sequence of events.

President Hassan Rouhani described the crash as an "unforgivable mistake".

Image copyright BBC#

Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei ordered the military to investigate "the possible shortcomings or mistakes" that led to the crash.

The initial Iranian military statement said the plane's downing was due to "human error" after the aircraft had flown close to a "sensitive site" belonging to Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps .

The commercial airliner was mistaken for a "hostile plane", the statement said.

Hours later, the man responsible for the unit that fired the missile, Revolutionary Guards aerospace commander Brig-Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh told journalists the aircraft had been shot down by a short-range missile that exploded next to it.

The Iranian operator had mistaken the Boeing for a "cruise missile". They tried to communicate with it and waited for 10 seconds for a reply before deciding to open fire, the general said.

He added that a request had been made for a no-fly zone in the area before the incident but this was rejected. The reasons for this remain unclear.

In fact, it appears the Iranian strikes on US bases did not affect operations at Imam Khomenei International Airport on Wednesday morning. Flight PS752 was the ninth to take off after the strikes, according to Flightradar24.

Is this likely to end the controversy?

Iran's admission of responsibility is an effort at de-escalation, says the BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet

But an important question remains.

Gen Hajizadeh told the media that he had informed the authorities about what had happened on Wednesday - the day of the accident.

So why did it take three days for Iran to admit it?

The president of Ukraine International Airlines said: "We didn't doubt for a second that our crew and our plane couldn't be the cause for this horrible crash".

But the company has denied that the plane veered from its expected course before the crash. It says officials should have closed the airport.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Iran to punish those responsible. "We expect Iran... to bring the guilty to the courts," he said.

And Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: "We will continue working with our partners around the world to ensure a complete and thorough investigation."

What will the investigation look like?

Under international protocol, the country where the plane crashes usually leads the investigation.

As the aircraft was made in the US, US officials, including from its National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), would typically participate in any inquiry.

Iran had initially ruled out handing over any information to the US authorities - after all, in addition to the current tensions, the two countries have no diplomatic relations.

However, Iran's representative at the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization told Reuters on Thursday that Iran had formally invited the NTSB to take part in the investigation, and it has agreed to assign an investigator.

Boeing, the plane's manufacturer, has said it is ready to assist in the investigation and will support the NTSB.

But it is unclear what kind of investigation can be carried out now that it is known the plane did not crash, but was brought down.

Who was on board?

The passenger manifest lists 176 people - 15 of them children - giving their names and dates of birth, but not their nationalities.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko initially released details that said there were 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians including all nine crew, 10 Swedes, four Afghans, three Britons and three Germans on board.

However, on 10 January, Canada's Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said the number of Canadians on the plane was now believed to be 57.

The German government also contradicted the Ukrainian figures. It said it was not aware that any of its citizens had been on board the flight.

It later emerged that three Afghans - a mother and her two children - who had been granted asylum in the country were passengers on the downed flight.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that four British nationals were on board.

Some of the differences the figures may well be due to dual nationalities.

Iran's head of emergency operations said 147 of the victims were Iranian. That would suggest that 65 of the foreign nationals had dual nationalities, which Iran does not recognise.</text><tags>Ukraine Iran plane crash, Aviation safety, Iran, Air travel, Aviation accidents and incidents, Ukraine Iran plane crash, Ukraine</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/51132054<category>sport</category><title>Australian Open 2020: Coco Gauff faces Venus Williams, Johanna Konta draws Ons Jabeur</title><text>Johanna Konta's best result at the Australian Open was reaching the semi-finals in 2016

2020 Australian Open Venue: Melbourne Park Dates: 20 January to 2 February Coverage: Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra and online; Live text on selected matches on the BBC Sport website and app.

American teenager Coco Gauff will again face Venus Williams in the first round of a Grand Slam after the pair were drawn together at the Australian Open.

Gauff, 15, announced her arrival on the biggest stage by beating 39-year-old Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam singles winner, at Wimbledon in July.

Britain's Johanna Konta, seeded 12th, will play Tunisia's Ons Jabeur.

In the men's draw, British 30th seed Dan Evans meets American Mackenzie McDonald in Melbourne.

Evans, 29, is playing in his first Slam as Britain's leading male player and could face Serbia's defending champion Novak Djokovic in the third round.

Djokovic, who is aiming for a record-extending eighth title, does not have the easiest opener after being drawn against Germany's world number 37 Jan-Lennard Struff.

The first Grand Slam of the year begins on Monday with the top half of the women's draw and the bottom half of the men's draw in action.

Gauff's match against Venus Williams seems certain to feature in the first night session on Rod Laver Arena with Djokovic, Roger Federer, Serena Williams, 2019 women's champion Naomi Osaka, Konta and Evans among those also playing on day one.

Swiss great Federer has been drawn in the same half as second seed Djokovic, meaning the pair could meet in the semi-finals.

Federer, 38, starts against American Steve Johnson and has a favourable-looking draw, although Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov - who memorably beat the Swiss in the US Open quarter-finals in September - and Canada's exciting talent Denis Shapovolov are potential opponents before the quarter-finals.

Spanish top seed Rafael Nadal plays against Bolivia's Hugo Dellien in the first round, with the possibility of a blockbuster fourth-round match against Australia's Nick Kyrgios.

The pair have not always seen eye-to-eye and met in a dramatic second-round match at Wimbledon last year, where Kyrgios tried to rattle Nadal with constant complaints about the Spaniard's slow play.

British number two Cameron Norrie plays Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert in his opening match, while Kyle Edmund - who reached the semi-finals in Melbourne two years ago but has dropped to 69th in the world - has a tough opener against Serbia's 24th seed Dusan Lajovic.

Russian fourth seed Daniil Medvedev, looking to win his first Grand Slam after reaching the 2019 US Open final, has been pitched against dangerous American floater Frances Tiafoe, who reached the quarter-finals last year.

Australia's world number 21 Alex de Minaur pulled out on Thursday with an abdominal injury aggravated at last week's ATP Cup.

Konta could face Serena Williams in last 16

With Gauff playing Venus Williams again, eyes were immediately focused on that section of the draw - an exciting quarter which also features Serena Williams among a host of stand-out names.

The 38-year-old takes on Russian 18-year-old Anastasia Potapova first as she aims for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam singles title, and could face Gauff or her older sister in the quarter-finals.

Osaka is also in the same quarter, the Japanese third seed starting against Czech Marie Bouzkova.

Briton Konta, who reached the semi-finals in Melbourne in 2016, is another pitched into this loaded part of the women's draw.

Serena Williams is a possible opponent in the last 16 for the British number one, who could also face 2018 champion and former world number one Caroline Wozniacki in the third round.

The 29-year-old Dane, who enrolled at Harvard Business School in September and was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 2018, is retiring after the tournament, saying she has realised "there is more to life".

Britain's Katie Boulter aims to put a season wrecked by injury behind her after using her protected ranking of 85 to enter the year's first major, but must take on Ukrainian fifth seed Elina Svitolina in her opening match.

British number two Heather Watson, ranked 101st, will play Czech world number 62 Kristyna Pliskova, twin sister of second seed Karolina.

Karolina Pliskova, who is aiming for a first Grand Slam title, has a tricky opener against France's former world number 10 Kristina Mladenovic.

Top seed and home favourite Ashleigh Barty opens against Ukraine's Lesia Tsurenko.

Analysis

BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller at Melbourne Park

Six months on from her famous victory on Wimbledon's Court One, Coco Gauff is still just 15 years of age. Venus Williams, 39, missed her first two tournaments of the year through injury.

Gauff seems to be able to play without pressure, and takes the view 'the bigger they are, the harder they fall'. What a start to the championships that will be.

Johanna Konta's path through the draw is a very challenging one. She might run into both Caroline Wozniacki and Serena Williams before the fourth round is out.

But having played just one match since September, Konta will only be focused on her first round with the artistic Tunisian Ons Jabeur, who beat her in Eastbourne in June.

Katie Boulter only returned to the tour in November after six months out with a stress fracture. She has been playing lower level events to regain fitness, so Elina Svitolina is a brutal first-round draw.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51091083<category>health</category><title>NHS to pioneer cholesterol-busting jab</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images

A twice-a-year injection that reduces bad cholesterol to protect the heart is to be pioneered by the NHS in England.

Already, millions of people take daily statin pills to cut their cholesterol.

But later this year, a "ground-breaking" large-scale clinical trial will offer NHS patients a new form of medicine, gene silencing, in an injection called inclisiran.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the initiative could save 30,000 lives during the next decade.

Why is cholesterol a problem?

Bad cholesterol (officially called non-high-density lipoproteins cholesterol) can build up inside the walls of blood vessels, making them narrower and increasing the risk of having a heart attack or stroke.

A bloodstream-tussle takes place between "bad" cholesterol which dumps fatty material in the arteries and good cholesterol taking it away.

What is the new drug?

It is called inclisiran and it is given by injection every six months.

It is part of a new form of medicine called gene-silencing.

Inclisiran does not modify our DNA, but it controls the instructions the body gets.

It does this by "silencing" the PCSK9 gene, which results in the liver absorbing more "bad" cholesterol from the blood and breaking it down.

The first gene-silencing medicine was approved for NHS use last year for a relatively rare disease, hereditary trans thyretin-mediated amyloidosis.

How big an impact could inclisiran have?

Trials presented at the European Society of Cardiology last year showed it could cut bad cholesterol levels in half within weeks.

Prof Kausik Ray, who led those trials, from Imperial College London, says this gives it "enormous" potential.

And the Department of Health and Social Care says it would prevent 55,000 heart attacks and strokes each year for every 300,000 patients treated.

Who will be offered the drug?

The drug is not yet a licensed medicine, but a deal between the NHS and the pharmaceutical company means patients will be access the drug later this year as part of a large-scale clinical trial.

NHS patients who have not had a heart attack or stroke but are at high risk of having one will be invited to take part.

About 40,000 people might be eligible.

Inclisiran will also be assessed for more routine use next year based on evidence from previous trials.

At the moment - because of the way decisions on health are devolved within the UK - the announcement applies only in England.

What is special about this trial?

The NHS has described this collaboration between the health service, drug company Novartis and researchers as "ground-breaking".

"It is certainly innovative, exciting and a step-change in the way we do clinical trials," Prof Martin Landray, who will lead the trial from the University of Oxford.

Inclisiran is a drug people could potentially take for decades so it is essential to be able to monitor the long-term risks and benefits of taking the drugs.

Will this replace regular statins?

Statins are a cornerstone of heart medicine that are taken by millions of people in the UK.

They work by lowering levels of bad cholesterol.

However, some patients have such high cholesterol that it is still at dangerous levels even with statins.

And studies have shown they do not work well enough in roughly half of patients.

There are many types of statin and some patients could be on the wrong one. Or patients may be forgetting to take their daily pill.

It is some of these issues that having two injections a year might help with.

What do the experts say?

Prof Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow, said: "Doctors are excited by inclisiran and the potential to 'vaccinate' against high cholesterol in some patients.

"However, many would also like to see longer term safety data from ongoing trials and to be told the cost of this new drug before they consider implications for care."

Prof Jacob George, from the University of Dundee, said: "Whilst inclisiran has not yet been assessed by the European Medicines Agency or the FDA [US Food and Drug Administration], giving patients access to these innovative new medications within the safety confines of a large-scale trial is welcome news."

And Dr Riyaz Patel, clinical lead for cardiovascular disease prevention at Barts Health NHS Trust, said: "This as a really exciting announcement that changes the way we bring new medicines to patients earlier and [will] also propel the NHS and the UK as a world leader in this sort of clinical research.

"It is certainly a welcome step forwards to get exciting new drugs to patients quickly and safely."</text><tags>NHS, Medicine, Heart disease, Strokes, Medical research</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48481814<category>world</category><title>Virginia Beach shooting: 12 killed after city worker opens fire at colleagues</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Virginia Beach witness: 'We barricaded the door'

At least 12 people were killed and several injured on Friday in a mass shooting at a government building in the US state of Virginia.

The suspect, described by officials as a disgruntled city employee in Virginia Beach, fired indiscriminately in a municipal building.

The gunman, identified by police as DeWayne Craddock, was killed in an exchange of gunfire with police.

Officials said an officer was wounded when a bullet struck his vest.

How did the shooting unfold?

The attack began shortly after 16:00 (20:00 GMT), at Virginia Beach Municipal Center, in an area which is home to a number of city government buildings. The area was put into lockdown by police and employees were evacuated.

"We just heard people yelling and screaming at people to get down," Megan Banton, an administrative assistant in the building, told local television news station WAVY.

One of the victims was shot outside in a car, and the rest were found over three floors of the government building.

Four officers entered the building and located the gunman inside and "immediately engaged" him, police chief James Cervera said. The attacker was then shot dead.

The police chief described the scene as a "war zone".

"I want you to know that during this gun battle, basically the officers stopped this individual from committing more carnage in that building," Mr Cervera said.

Police recovered a rifle and a handgun, thought to have been used by the suspect, at the scene.

Tragedy ahead of gun awareness day

Harry Low, BBC News, Virginia Beach

As police cars, blue lights flashing, line the perimeter of the Virginia Beach municipal offices, rain continues to fall.

At the end of a shortened working week following Monday's Memorial Day holiday, many families are facing a future without their loved ones.

Survivors speak of sleepless nights ahead. Virginia's largest city has now become the site for this country's largest mass shooting in 2019.

The latest tragedy has taken place ahead of the annual National Gun Violence Awareness Day on Sunday. This will provide little comfort to those who want to see an end to the easy access to guns which frequently bring schools and cities across America to prominence for all the wrong reasons.

What is known about the victims?

They have been identified as 11 municipal employees and one contractor.

At least four people are known to have been wounded, including the police officer, but the severity of their injuries remained unclear.

The injured officer's life was saved by his bulletproof vest.

A White House spokesman said President Trump had been briefed about the shooting.

The FBI was at the scene helping local authorities investigate the shooting, US media reported.

'The most devastating day'

Virginia Senator Tim Kaine said on Twitter he was "devastated to learn of the tragic shooting tonight in Virginia Beach".

"My heart is with everyone who lost a loved one, and I'm praying for a swift recovery for all those who have been injured," he said.

Skip Twitter post by @timkaine I&#8217;m devastated to learn of the tragic shooting tonight in Virginia Beach. My heart is with everyone who lost a loved one, and I&#8217;m praying for a swift recovery for all those who have been injured. &#8212; Tim Kaine (@timkaine) May 31, 2019 Report

Robert Dyer, the city's mayor, said: "This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach."

Virginia governor Ralph Northam described the incident as a "tragic day" for the city and the state.

"Our hearts ache over the senseless violence that has been inflicted upon the Virginia Beach community today," he told reporters.

According to US tracking website Gun Violence Archive, the incident is the 150th mass shooting in the US so far in 2019.

Described by those who know him as "a Boy Scout" with wry humour, Mr Schiff, 59, has kept a low profile over his nine previous terms in the US House of Representatives.

But as chairman of the House intelligence committee, the former prosecutor has become the face of the Democrats' impeachment of President Donald Trump.

As lead impeachment manager, he will serve as a prosecutor for the House, making the case to oust the president in only the third US impeachment trial in history.

"I'm humbled by the solemn responsibility," Mr Schiff said of his appointment. "The task before us is a grave but necessary one."

Early aspirations

Born in Massachusetts to a Democratic father and Republican mother, Mr Schiff grew up in California and later earned degrees at Stanford University and Harvard Law School.

In 1987, he joined the Los Angeles US Attorney's office.

As a young prosecutor, Mr Schiff won praise for his work on a case that led to the first conviction of an FBI agent for espionage. The agent was discovered to have had an affair with a Soviet spy, giving her intelligence in exchange for money and sex.

It was punishing government misconduct in that case which inspired him to jump into politics, his father would later say.

From Hollywood Hills to Capitol Hill

Mr Schiff's career in politics began with two failed campaigns for the California assembly, in 1991 and 1994, before he won a state senate seat in 1996 on his third attempt. Four years later, he unseated a Republican to become the US congressman for the California district stretching from Pasadena to the Hollywood Hills, now a reliably Democratic seat.

His defeated opponent, James Rogan, had become unpopular in part due to his fervent prosecution of Bill Clinton during the Democratic president's Senate impeachment trial.

In 2008, Mr Schiff was appointed to the House intelligence committee, becoming chairman last year after Democrats won a majority in the House.

Unlikely political star

In March 2017, the House intelligence committee began looking into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible Russian links to the Trump campaign. At the time, the committee was led by Republicans.

Mr Schiff drew national attention - and the ire of the president - after speaking out in the media about the Russia investigation and what he viewed as attempts to discredit the inquiry.

Mr Schiff's prominence grew after the disclosure last year of a whistleblower complaint alleging that the president had sought foreign interference into the US election. The congressman led the ensuing impeachment investigation, becoming a political star in the process.

'Shifty Schiff' or 'the full package'?

His criticism of the president has turned Mr Schiff into a frequent target for Mr Trump, whose Twitter account is laced with mocking nicknames for the chairman, including 'Liddle Adam' and 'Shifty Schiff'.

Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, on the other hand, has lauded Mr Schiff as "the full package". When she named the congressman and the other impeachment managers on 15 January, she noted they were chosen with an eye to their "on comfort level in the courtroom".

"The emphasis is on making the strongest possible case to defend our Constitution," she said - a nod to her confidence in Mr Schiff's skills as a litigator.

Republicans have accused him of pursuing a vendetta against Mr Trump, and echo the president's claims that he is corrupt. He is booed at Trump rallies and lampooned on Fox News.

An amateur screenwriter in his spare time- though his teleplays have so far failed to sell - Mr Schiff has said that he never imagined becoming a household name, although when he came up in a question on the gameshow Jeopardy! not a single contestant had heard of him.

Now, he is poised to step into the spotlight as he writes a chapter in America's most riveting modern political drama.

Jun Yu can't resist gadgets.

More than 20 smartphones, old tablets and other devices lurk in a corner of his Beijing home - an ever-growing tech junkyard.

His apartment also boasts a Google Home smart assistant and an Amazon Echo.

"I take three phones out with me every day. I use a phone for Chinese apps, I use my iPhone for Gmail and western apps, and I use my Google Pixel phone for work," says the 34-year-old tech entrepreneur.

His obsession has paid off though. In 2009, he bought the first phone to use Android, the software that now runs more than 80% of smartphones.

A year later, the physics graduate, founded his own company creating content for Chinese Android users. By 2016 he had sold the company for an undisclosed amount to Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant.

Now he is excited about the next generation of technology, known as 5G. It promises lightning fast internet connections for your mobile phone - fast enough to download movies in a matter of seconds, or to stream high definition TV.

In October, Jun Yu pre-ordered a 5G-ready smartphone, made by China's Xiaomi.

"4G has enabled many things like mobile video, more immersive gaming. I know 5G will too. But I don't exactly know how yet," he says.

But in the US and UK the rollout of 5G networks has been hampered by an international row over one of the most important suppliers of 5G equipment, China's Huawei.

Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.

The US has banned the use of Huawei equipment in 5G networks over security fears, and has encouraged its allies to do the same. It also maintains a tight control over what US companies can sell to Huawei, which has disrupted sales of Huawei phones overseas.

Industry analysts like Edison Lee, an analyst from financial services group Jefferies, see the US pressure on Huawei as an attempt to break China's potential dominance of the global 5G market.

"The tech war is based on America's argument that China's technological advances have been built upon stolen intellectual property rights, and heavy government subsidies, and their belief that Chinese telecom equipment is not safe, and is a national security threat to the US and its allies," he says.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Huawei has built around half of China's 5G network

"As Huawei and [fellow Chinese firm] ZTE increasingly dominate the global telecom equipment market, the western world will be more vulnerable to Chinese spying," Lee adds.

Huawei has always strongly denied that its technology can be used for spying.

While western nations worry about one of the key suppliers of 5G technology, China is racing ahead with its 5G rollout.

On 31 October Chinese telecom companies launched 5G services in more than 50 Chinese cities, creating one of the world's largest 5G networks.

Huawei has built an estimated 50% of the network.

The Chinese Ministry of Information claims that in just 20 days the country registered more than 800,000 subscribers. Analysts predict China will have as many as 110 million 5G users by 2020.

And China's tech sector is busy coming up with uses for the new tech.

Image copyright HK Applied Science Institute Image caption 5G could be a key piece of technology for autonomous cars

On a large plot of land in northern Hong Kong, researchers are developing 5G powered autonomous vehicles.

Researchers at Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institution are working in partnership with China Mobile, the largest telecom company in China.

They see 5G as being particularly useful for self-driving cars, allowing the cars to build an accurate picture of what's going on around them, by communicating with other vehicles, traffic signals and sensors in the road.

"For consumers, 5G will possibly transform how we interact with other. For the government, 5G will transform roads and road infrastructure to enable new applications like enhanced assisted-driving and eventually autonomous driving," says Alex Mui, a researcher on the project.

China is not the first country to roll out 5G. But it is building one of the world's biggest 5G markets very quickly.

While Huawei and ZTE are doing well from that expansion, they would still like to break into lucrative overseas markets like the US.

Speaking at a 5G convention in Beijing in November, China's minister for industry and information accused America of using cybersecurity as an excuse for protectionism.

"No country should ban a company in its 5G network rollout by using the unproved allegations of cybersecurity risks," said Miao Wei.

More Technology of Business

Industry analysts are not confident that the row between China and the US will be sorted out anytime soon.

"We see the current tensions as a technological Cold War, as tech nationalism intensifies," says Ben Wood, chief of research, at CCS Insight.

"With the Chinese government firmly committed to establishing China as a world-leading 5G nation, the opportunity for Huawei in its home market is immense.

"However, the rest of the world can't afford to get left behind, and without access to Huawei infrastructure US mobile network operators in particular will need to rely on alternative suppliers who may be more expensive and less advanced with 5G."</text><tags>China, 5G, ZTE, Huawei, Apps</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-48881867<category>world</category><title>Rio Olympics: Ex-governor says he paid $2m bribe</title><text>Image copyright Reuters Image caption S&#233;rgio Cabral celebrated Rio's successful bid with President Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva in 2009

A former governor of Rio de Janeiro says he helped pay a $2m (&#163;1.6m) bribe to secure the Olympic Games for the Brazilian city in 2016.

S&#233;rgio Cabral told a judge the payment was made to secure votes in the decision-making meeting in 2009.

He said that Carlos Nuzman, then the chairman of the Brazilian Olympic Committee, handled the negotiations.

In 2017, Mr Nuzman was arrested amid an investigation into the alleged vote-buying scheme. He denies wrongdoing.

Cabral is currently serving a 200-year sentence for several corruption cases.

On Thursday, he said the then-president of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), Senegal's Lamine Diack, also served as intermediary in the alleged deal.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The opening ceremony at Rio's Maracana Stadium in August 2016

Mr Diack is to stand trial in France, having been arrested there in 2015. He has been accused of taking payments for deferring sanctions against Russian drugs cheats. He has previously denied wrongdoing, but has not yet responded to the latest allegations.

Both Mr Diack and Mr Nuzman were suspended from their roles, and later resigned.

Cabral also said Brazil's then-president, Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva, had been informed after the money had allegedly changed hands.

Lula's lawyers have said this is untrue. He has been jailed in a separate corruption case.

Why has this come out now?

Ongoing criminal investigations into alleged bribery - led by prosecutors in Brazil and France - have already implicated Mr Nuzman, Mr Diack and his son, and then-IOC executive board member Frank Fredericks.

However, no leading officials have admitted involvement until now.

Cabral, who served two terms as Rio state governor from 2007 to 2014, spoke out during a hearing requested by his new defence team as he seeks a plea deal.

He hopes the information might reduce his lengthy sentences faced by him.

He was convicted of passive corruption, money laundering and embezzlement &#8211; linked to various cases from an expos&#233; known as Operation Carwash. His wife, Adriana Ancelmo, was also jailed after a period under house arrest.

Several high-powered Brazilian executives and politicians have recently reduced their sentences through plea bargains and giving evidence against others.

Who else was named?

Cabral told investigators that his bribe had been aimed at winning the support of nine of the committee's 95 members.

He implicated several top athletes who had voting rights. Olympic gold medallists Sergey Bubka and Alexander Popov have both since denied taking a bribe, and said they were considering suing for defamation.

Mr Popov, a Russian former swimmer, released a statement via social media, saying he did not vote for the city, or participate in any negotiations.

Mr Bukba, a Ukrainian pole-vault champion, posted a series of tweets, in which he said he completely rejected "all the false claims made by the former Rio State governor".

Skip Twitter post by @sergey_bubka I will instruct my lawyers to use all the legal means at their disposal and to reserve all my rights &#8212; Sergey Bubka (@sergey_bubka) July 5, 2019 Report

The ex-governor also said the money was provided by businessman Arthur Soares, one of his close friends, and transferred to Diack's son, Papa Massata, who has previously denied wrongdoing.

Brazilian prosecutors charged Mr Soares - nicknamed King Arthur - for alleged involvement in bribery in 2017. He moved to the US during the investigations.

What does the IOC say?

The International Olympics Commission (IOC) says its chief ethics officer is following up on the latest allegations.

The IOC implemented a series of reforms in 2014. On Friday, it said: "The IOC is fully committed to address any issues, including those which happened before the far-reaching reforms."

Rio won its Olympic bid in 2009, beating co-finalists Chicago, Madrid and Tokyo. It was the first South American city ever to host the Games.

In January, news broke that the bidding process for Tokyo 2020 was also under investigation by French authorities.

The Japanese government has always insisted its Tokyo bid was clean.</text><tags>Brazil, Rio de Janeiro</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39115829<category>world</category><title>Amazing views and dirty air in French Alps</title><text>Image caption French Alps: Few skiers are aware of the air pollution problem in some valleys

Camille Jouvenceau has an amazing view of Western Europe's highest mountain, Mont Blanc, from the balcony of her apartment in the pretty town of Sallanches. But the mountain air does not entice her.

"The air stinks outside, so you think twice about going out," she says.

She has had bronchitis, asthma and ear infections on and off since the end of November, when the fine particle pollution started peaking at red alert levels.

"Before you leave the house you ask yourself whether the air's going to make you cough or make your eyes stream or you have to spit," says Ms Jouvenceau, 24. "I leave earlier now when I go to work, so that I can walk slowly and of course I've stopped cycling or doing any sport."

It's like this every year in the 105km-long (65-mile) Arve Valley, home to 150,000 people and surrounded by some of the world's most famous ski resorts - Megeve, Saint Gervais and Chamonix.

Seasonal scourge

The pollution from fine (PM10) and ultra-fine (PM2.5) particles - the ones that get right down into your bronchial tubes and do the most damage - is now dangerously high for an average of 40 days a year.

In winter, this part of the Alps has the worst fine-particle pollution in France.

Image caption A cloud of dirty air hangs over Sallanches

The problem is compounded by the fact that, at the bottom of these deep mountain valleys, the air is often cooler than higher up. Since it is cooler, the air does not rise or disperse easily.

Prof Frank Kelly, chair of environmental health at King's College, London, says the mountains also block the wind, "rather like the mountains north of Beijing, which stop the dispersal of the wind-borne pollution from the south". He has been working with the French on a monitoring project in the Arve Valley.

At St Joseph's Infant and Primary School, the youngest children are kept inside at break time, while the older ones are allowed into the playground, but are not allowed to run around.

Image caption Children get less time to run around - so that they avoid taking big gulps of bad air

"Since the pollution alert started, the authorities have stopped all school sport," says head teacher Nathalie Gex.

"No skating, no swimming pool even. Our gym teacher's been giving theatre classes instead. At break time we give the older children chalk to draw on the ground, and cards and building blocks to play with, to make sure they don't move too much."

Wood-burning tradition

It's a beautiful day and I climb up above Sallanches - by car of course, I'm not going hiking in this air.

I was told you can see the pollution from up here. Well, you absolutely can. There is a thick, white quilt of it lying across the town.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Diesel fumes from Mont Blanc Tunnel lorries contribute to air pollution but are not the biggest cause

The other thing you can see from up the mountain is the main cause. Surprisingly, perhaps, it is not the lorries grinding up the valley towards the Mont Blanc Tunnel and Italy.

No, the main cause is a renewable energy source with an environmentally-friendly reputation - the humble wood-burning stove. Columns of smoke are rising from many of the houses.

"The latest surveys show that between 60% and 80% of fine-particle pollution here comes from wood-burning stoves and fireplaces in people's homes," says Vincent Hazout, who recently organised a demonstration calling for action against air pollution. It rallied 1,000 people in Sallanches.

Image caption Pretty villages create Alpine charm - but big volumes of wood smoke are harmful

Mr Hazout's six-year-old son is currently ill with asthma. When he was his son's age, he suffered from asthma too. His family lived in Paris but took the decision to leave because of young Vincent's health. They came to Alps for the "clean mountain air".

"Now we'll have to move too for my son, like my parents moved for me, unless we can solve this pollution problem," Mr Hazout says.

Image caption Pollution from wood-burning stoves tends to linger in the valleys

Clean-up campaign

The power to do something about the air in this valley lies mainly with the representative of central government, called the prefect.

His office, though declining an interview, provided details of all the anti-air pollution measures taken this winter - and there are quite a few of them: restrictions on the most-polluting heavy goods vehicles, a voluntary slow-down of some industrial activity, a decrease in volume of refuse-burning and a ban on burning wood for households with alternative means of heating.

"Clearly insufficient," says Mr Hazout. "The authorities don't want to implement more drastic measures, for fear of blackening the image of the ski resorts."

Image caption The pistes around Mont Blanc (left) are a magnet for skiers

So how are things up on the pistes?

In Chamonix, which attracts thousands of skiers each year, Mayor Eric Fournier says that on the slopes you are fine as you are above the danger zone, and that even in the town the pollution is not nearly as bad as it is down in the valley.

He also says air quality is actually improving in Chamonix, because of an upgrade scheme for wood-burning stoves, which he has put in place.

But the air quality in Chamonix on winter evenings is still poor. Plenty of wood smoke continues to pump fine particles into the air, despite this scheme.

For Vincent Hazout, the way forward is obvious. But it will take political will. Changing the way people heat their homes would have to become far more financially attractive or, if that failed, mandatory.

Prof Kelly agrees. "This pollution has three causes: the topography, the climate and the use of wood as heating fuel. We can't change the first two - although the Chinese have been experimenting with making rain to wash away pollution - but we can act on the wood-burning," he says.

In January 2015, the authorities in the Paris region banned the use of open fireplaces (more polluting than closed ones), before Ecology Minister Segolene Royal intervened to lift the order.

Many people in the French Alps hope that that measure, or an even more comprehensive ban on wood-heating, will be applied here.

"In two years," says Mr Hazout, "we could have this problem solved".

So I Can Breathe

A week of coverage by BBC News looking at ways to cut air pollution.</text><tags>Air pollution, Pollution, France</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51017852<category>business</category><title>Travelex being held to ransom by hackers</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images

Hackers are holding foreign exchange company Travelex to ransom after a cyber-attack forced the firm to turn off all computer systems and resort to using pen and paper.

On New Year's Eve, hackers launched their attack on the Travelex network.

As a result, the company took down its websites across 30 countries to contain "the virus and protect data".

A ransomware gang called Sodinokibi has told the BBC it is behind the hack and wants Travelex to pay $6m (&#163;4.6m).

The gang, also known as REvil, claims to have gained access to the company's computer network six months ago and to have downloaded 5GB of sensitive customer data.

Dates of birth, credit card information and national insurance numbers are all in their possession, they say.

The hackers said: "In the case of payment, we will delete and will not use that [data]base and restore them the entire network.

"The deadline for doubling the payment is two days. Then another seven days and the sale of the entire base."

Police probe

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it had not received a data breach report from Travelex.

A spokeswoman added: "Organisations must notify the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach unless it does not pose a risk to people's rights and freedoms.

"If an organisation decides that a breach doesn't need to be reported, they should keep their own record of it and be able to explain why it wasn't reported if necessary."

Under General Data Protection Regulation, a company that fails to comply can face a maximum fine of 4% of its global turnover.

The Metropolitan Police is leading the investigation into the attack.

In a statement, the force said: "On Thursday, 2 January, the Met's Cyber Crime Team were contacted with regards to a reported ransomware attack involving a foreign currency exchange. Inquiries into the circumstances are ongoing."

Travelex says it is working with police and has deployed teams of IT specialists and external cyber-security experts who have been working continuously.

'Shockingly bad'

According to Fabian Wosar, a ransomware expert at cyber security company Emsisoft, the attack has all the hallmarks of the REvil gang.

"With what we know about the incident and the hackers' mode of operation in the past paints a consistent picture, which leads me to believe that REvil indeed hit Travelex," he said.

"The REvil/Sodinokibi group has been a quite sophisticated group for a long time now. The quoted ransom demands are consistent for the gang's victims of Travelex's size.

"Stealing data essentially gives threat actors additional bargaining chips when it comes to dealing with companies unwilling to pay the ransom. The idea is to weaponise the hefty fines associated with GDPR violations to pressure the company into paying."

The recovery operation is being co-ordinated from a Travelex office in the UK and the company insists that no customer data has been leaked.

But it would not say what data could potentially be at risk.

Travelex websites across Europe, Asia and the US have been offline since 31 December, with a message to visitors that they are down for "planned maintenance".

Image copyright Travelex Image caption Visitors to the Travelex website are told that the site is down for "planned maintenance".

Customers have not been sent any email communication about the cyber-attack, but queries are being replied to on social media by the company.

"The public response from Travelex has been shockingly bad," said security researcher Kevin Beaumont.

"The Travelex UK website still only says 'planned maintenance', a week after the problems began - many customers will be completely unaware hackers gained access to their network, and allegedly their personal data," he said.

"Travelex have a responsibility to clearly communicate with customers and business partners the gravity of the situation."

Travelex's decision to take down its site has meant the large network of other firms that use its services cannot sell currency online.

The company has said it is keeping its partners up to date on the response to the cyber-attack.

Virgin Money's site showed an error message, which said: "Our online, foreign currency purchasing service is temporarily unavailable due to planned maintenance. The system will be back online shortly."

Sainsbury's Bank also said its online travel money services were unavailable, although it said customers could still buy travel money in its stores. In a statement to the BBC, the bank said: "We're in close contact with Travelex so that we can resume our online service as soon as possible."

Image copyright Sainsbury's Image caption Sainsbury's Bank's website said it was not able to take money orders online.

A spokesperson for First Direct, which is owned by HSBC, said: "Unfortunately, our online travel money service is currently unavailable due to a service issue with third party service provider, Travelex."

In a statement on Thursday, Travelex boss Tony D'Souza said: "We regret having to suspend some of our services in order to contain the virus and protect data."

The company has resorted to carrying out transactions manually, providing foreign-exchange services over the counter in its branches.

"We apologise to all our customers for any inconvenience caused as a result," Mr D'Souza said in the statement.

The company has since told the BBC that its systems are currently down and it is unable to sell or reload its pre-paid travel cards. But, it said: "Existing cards continue to function as normal and customers in the UK can continue to spend and withdraw money from ATMs.

"For customers who have ordered money online, please contact Travelex customer services by phone or via social media to discuss their individual situation and requirements."

Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have reached an initial deal on the filling and operation of what will be Africa's biggest hydro-electric dam.

The three nations agreed, following a meeting in Washington DC, that the mega dam on the River Nile should be filled in stages during the rainy season.

Ethiopia, which is building the dam, wants to start generating electricity as soon as possible.

But Egypt is concerned about its water supplies if it is filled too fast.

The preliminary agreement, brokered by US treasury secretary and the World Bank president, is short on details, says the BBC's Emmanuel Igunza.

Some delicate negotiations will be needed before the Grand Renaissance Dam agreement is finalised later this month, he says.

Is this a breakthrough?

Negotiators are presenting this as a win-win for both Egypt and Ethiopia. There have been fears the countries could be drawn into war if it is unresolved.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Egypt considers reduction of the Nile flow as an existential threat

According to the joint statement, filling the dam in stages during the July and August wet season will allow for Ethiopia's "early generation of electricity" while "providing appropriate mitigation measures for Egypt and Sudan in case of severe droughts".

Ethiopia, which began construction of the $4bn (&#163;3bn) dam in 2011 on the Blue Nile, a tributary that contributes 85% of the Nile waters, has always said it wants the dam to be filled within six years.

Egypt has maintained that a longer period - of between 10 and 21 years - would be better so that the water flow is not drastically reduced.

No time period is specified in the preliminary agreement.

What happens next?

The dam is already 80% complete, and it looks like Ethiopia will start filling it according to the schedule it has always planned.

The final deal is expected to be signed on 28-29 January, when foreign and water ministers from the three countries meet again in the US capital.

It is hoped they can sell the final text to their governments to end the tensions.

But the main question is whether Egypt will be satisfied with the guarantees given by Ethiopia on the amount of water to be released during periods of drought.

The deal may also have a bearing on how the other eight countries on the Nile Basin choose to exploit the River Nile in the future.

How dependent is Egypt on the Nile?

Very. Most of Egypt is arid with almost no rainfall and relies on the Nile for 90% of its water.

Africa's longest river flows through the city of Aswan around 920km (570 miles) south of the capital Cairo.

One of the North African country's other main concerns is that if the water flow drops, it could affect Lake Nasser, the reservoir behind Egypt's Aswan Dam, which produces most of Egypt's electricity.

So these negotiations over the future of the Nile River's waters are considered a matter of survival for millions of Egyptians.

What is at stake for Ethiopia?

Ethiopia considers the dam a matter of sovereignty and has been critical of what it believes is foreign interference in the matter.

It started building its dam at the start of the Arab Spring in March 2011 without consulting Egypt.

It refused to be bound a 1929 treaty that gave Egypt and Sudan rights to almost all the Nile's water without considering upstream countries.

The dam, with a capacity to generate a massive 6,000 MW of electricity, is at the heart of the country's manufacturing and industrial dreams.

Ethiopia has an acute shortage of electricity, with 65% of its population not connected to the grid.

The energy generated will be enough to have its citizens connected and sell the surplus power to neighbouring countries, including Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya, Djibouti and Eritrea.

On 12 August, the small, serene city of Charlottesville, Virginia will mark the anniversary of a deadly white nationalist rally that shocked the nation.

The violence that day cost the life of a young counter-protester and scarred Charlottesville. An official report condemned city officials for failing to adequately prepare and police for standing by as confrontation turned to chaos.

In the year since, some residents have attempted to reckon with the legacy of that weekend and the racial inequality that persists in the city. Others have sought to consign the violence of last summer to the past, in an effort to restore to Charlottesville a lost reputation as a peaceful, progressive place - 2014's official Happiest City in America.

Here, in their own words, some of those closest to the events of that weekend tell the story of what happened, why it happened, and what it meant to a city and a nation. You may find some language offensive.

PROLOGUE: 'WE KNEW WE WERE IN FOR A BAD DAY'

Ryan Kelly, photographer, Charlottesville Daily Progress It's important to understand that this didn't happen in a vacuum, it didn't just pop up and surprise everybody. It felt over the course of the summer that things were building up in Charlottesville.

Brennan Gilmore, Charlottesville resident People hadn't quite understood the level of violence or hatred or the numbers of people coming to town, but the town was very much aware. It was like a hurricane was coming.

Jalane Schmidt, University of Virginia professor, Black Lives Matter activist The propaganda that the alt-right had put out was martial in its imagery. It was a march on Charlottesville. It was very militaristic. We felt like we were going to be under siege.

Dr Michael Williams, surgeon, UVA hospital We got a plan in place in anticipation, but I got a fair amount of push-back from my colleagues in surgery. They said "This is going to be a big nothing."

Seth Wispelwey, local minister It felt to me like a profound test. But there was no question about where I belonged and what I wanted to do.

Brenda Brown-Grooms, local minister We'd been monitoring the social media posts of the alt-right and they were detailing their hopes for the weekend, hopes for inciting a race war in the country, so we knew it was going to be dire.

Jalane Schmidt The crazy thing is we tried to warn the city. We had infiltrated chat rooms, taken screenshots. We made six dossiers, presented them to police, the city council, anyone who would listen. We said, "This is not a First Amendment rally. They are literally coming to kill us."

Emily Gorcenski, local activist There were explicit calls for violence there. We presented them to the city in the hope they would shut the rally down before it began.

Rev Brenda Brown-Grooms The information we gave them fell on deaf ears.

Emily Gorcenski When that failed, we knew we were in for a bad day.

'NAZIS STARTED COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK'

How it began - Many cities in America contended with their Confederate monuments and the legacy of slavery, but it would be Charlottesville, near the former capital of the Confederacy, that would bear the brunt of the controversy.

Jalane Schmidt In 2016 a young teenage activist here in Charlottesville started a petition to remove the Confederate monuments. At the same time, we had the Republican primary campaign heating up with Trump winning more and more states. Local white supremacists got upset about the efforts to remove the statues and they were fuelled by the feedback nationally, saying "This is OK, it's open season to be racist."

Zyahna Bryant, teenage activist I had to write a school paper about something I could change and I had been thinking about public spaces in Charlottesville. I thought it was important to draw attention to how Confederate imagery is violent and what it represents for people of colour. Eventually I turned my paper into a petition.

Wes Bellamy, Charlottesville councillor and former deputy mayor When I first started talking about moving the statues, people were livid, they hated hearing about it. I started getting racist abuse - "We're going to get you nigger," that kind of thing.

Zyahna Bryant For me, it's hard because there are no statues in Charlottesville that depict African-American heroes. And so for that reason alone, black people have nothing to look up to in our public spaces. We are not represented.

Jalane Schmidt Those statues were put up in the 1920s in order to edify the white public and they are still there for the edification of white people. And now people are shifting the reason. Now it's because they don't want to forget history?

Charles Weber, Charlottesville lawyer fighting the removal of the statues Our view was that the city didn't have the authority to do what they proposed to do. Aside from being magnificent works of art and places of beauty for the city, the statues are a memorial to war veterans. It's not in America's DNA to deny its own history.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Zyahna Bryant: "Black people have nothing to look up to in our public spaces"

Jalane Schmidt On 29 January 2017, the mayor called a press conference in front of the city hall. And he announced that Charlottesville was now the capital of the resistance. People cheered. That resonated with a lot of people, but it put a target on our backs.

Wes Bellamy The Nazis and Confederates started coming out of the woodwork. Then Jason Kessler came to light.

Jason Kessler, organiser, Unite the Right rally I wasn't really involved in local politics, I didn't find Charlottesville politics or any other politics very interesting. Then I was doing yard work one day for a friend and he happened to bring up the Robert E Lee statue and how the city was trying to tear it down. I thought it was symbolic of a lot of things happening in society.

Claire Gasta&#241;aga, executive director, ACLU Virginia Jason Kessler applied for a permit for a rally at Emancipation Park, some time last spring. The way the Charlottesville process works, a permit is granted automatically if there's no negative decision in 10 days.

Jason Kessler Shoot, the moment I put in the application didn't feel that eventful. After 10 days it was approved and I set about calling different people in the alternative media, on the internet. Some describe them as alt-right, some as alt-light.

Charles Weber Jason Kessler and Richard Spencer, both University of Virginia graduates, saw the argument over the statues as a way to promote their own cause. We were horrified by that.

Image copyright Julia Schmalz/CHE Image caption Jalane Schmidt, UVA professor and Black Lives Matter activist

Nikuyah Walker, counter-protester, now Charlottesville mayor People like Kessler and Spencer started to get a little leery of whether white supremacy would be maintained. That's what this was about: "How dare you, a primarily white council, vote to take down our statues?"

Jason Kessler Richard Spencer is a white nationalist. Personally I don't call myself a white nationalist. I consider myself a civil and human rights advocate, focused on the caucasian demographic.

Isaac Smith, former ally of Jason Kessler Kessler's idea was to try to unite the alt-right with the mainstream right, and get regular Republicans to show up.

Jason Kessler The moderate speakers did not want to be on the same stage as Richard Spencer, so it ended up being much more far right than I intended it to be.

Claire Gasta&#241;aga, executive director, ACLU Virginia People had been calling all that week for Kessler's permit to be revoked. After a series of closed meetings, Charlottesville council sent him a letter saying it was revoked but they would consider reissuing it if he moved the rally to a different location. He tweeted us at about 2am on the Tuesday before the weekend, asking if we would be interested in giving him legal assistance. There was nothing about his political positions that we agreed with, but there are rules and governments have to follow those rules. We filed a complaint on Thursday and the judge held a hearing on the Friday night, about 9pm, and ruled that the decision to revoke Kessler's permit was an unconstitutional decision based on the content of his speech. So the permit was reissued.

Walt Heinecke, University of Virginia professor We decided to apply for permits for counter-protests. I teach a class in citizenship so I thought it was time for me to put my money where my mouth was. We are in a battle for the soul of America at this point, and I thought it was time for people to step up.

'SUDDENLY THE FIELD WAS ALIGHT'

Friday night - White nationalist ralliers gather at Nameless Field in Charlottesville and march through the University of Virginia Campus carrying torches and chanting racist slogans. At a statue of Thomas Jefferson, they are met by student activists who link arms around the statue's base.

Emily Gorcenski, local activist We were expecting a torch march at some point. Jason Kessler is a local and we know how he operates. And there's only a few locations something like that could go down. At some point on Friday morning we heard it would be after dark at the university campus.

Walt Heinecke, counter-protest organiser About 9.45pm I was walking over to St Paul's Church, and as I stood on the corner of the park I saw Jason Kessler, Richard Spencer, and a bunch of other people walk by.

Alexis Gravely, UVA student reporter Me and the managing editor had been tipped off that something was going to happen on campus. We went down there and found a lot of people with unlit torches. They were kind of in the shadows and you couldn't tell who was who, but it was shocking to see how many people were there. I turned around to listen to Jason Kessler speak and when I turned back suddenly the field was alight. It was like it had happened in an instant.

Jason Kessler Lighting torches is a protest tactic that has been used by all kinds of different people. To think that the KKK invented marching symbolically with torches is outrageous. The way it was explained to me was that it was a funeral march for the fallen dead of our European ancestors.

Brennan Gilmore, Charlottesville resident There was an interfaith service across the road at St Paul's and my whole family was there. My one-year-old nephew started crying inside so we went outside and fell asleep, and when we woke up there were white nationalists marching past.

Jalane Schmidt, Black Lives Matter activist The preacher came in to the church and said there were Nazis outside with torches, there were hundreds of them and they were marching on the church. There was a lot of confusion. We thought maybe they were coming to the church to torch it. I heard "You will not replace us, Jews will not replace us." Seeing them, by the hundreds, the torches bobbing, it was horrifying.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jason Kessler at the UVA campus torch march

Dr Michael Williams, UVA surgeon We were made aware that university police were responding to an unexpected assembly, 150-200 people carrying torches.

Rev Brenda Brown-Grooms We were on lockdown at St Paul's, and when I finally got out I was sitting on the brick wall on the corner, and I saw this line of lights coming towards me. I thought "Oh God, these people can't come right up here."

Walt Heinecke, counter-protest organiser An activist came by and said "Your students are surrounded by Nazis." I ran over there with a friend and what I noticed was there was no police presence, and there were 150 or so Nazis, fascists with torches, screaming racial epithets. Student activists were around the Jefferson statue, locking arms peacefully, chanting "Black Lives Matter".

Emily Gorcenski There was a moment when I saw them marching towards us that I would describe as the worst thing I've ever felt in my life. It was absolute terror.

Alexis Gravely, UVA student reporter One of the things that struck me was the organisation - they were calling for men over 200 pounds to stand on the outside for security, things like that. It was loud, it was chaotic, it was booming in your ears.

Rev Brenda Brown-Grooms I could see and smell the torches. And unfortunately, as a person of colour in this country, I don't have to go back far to remember those things, to remember feeling totally unprotected, unheard, unseen, and unwanted.

Wes Bellamy, former deputy mayor There was a sense of anger that these cowards would march with torches and surround 20 college kids and try to intimidate them. That really showed me who those individuals were. And it let me know how serious it was.

Walt Heinecke I waded into the crowd of Nazis with the dean of students and we were assaulted - I got pepper-sprayed, the dean got a torch thrown at him, the students and counter-protesters were being beaten by these guys.

Rev Brenda Brown-Grooms We had been on lockdown in the church. Eventually police arrived over the road at the campus and people began to disperse. We filed out of the back door to avoid the nationalists in the street.

Dr Michael Williams, UVA surgeon That was the first clue that our worst fears might come to pass. My feeling for Saturday was "Oh God, this is really happening."

'WE SAW A WAVE COMING OVER THE HILL'

Saturday morning - Local religious leaders fan out across Charlottesville, some to lead prayer services and some to stand on the front line at Emancipation Park. As the morning progresses and the temperature rises, white nationalists and counter-protesters pour into the streets around the park.

Rev Brenda Brown-Grooms We had a sunrise service at six in the morning, at First Baptist Church, Main. It was hot as blazes, as it is wont to be in Charlottesville in August.

Christian Yingling, Pennsylvania Light Foot Militia We had what I call a pre-op briefing which we have before events, where we lay out the plan for the guys for the day. We were nervous. I could see it in the guys, the way they were gearing up. They knew it wasn't going to be good. When we first got to the park, about 7.30am, it was tense.

Brennan Gilmore, Charlottesville resident As soon as I got downtown I knew Charlottesville had completely transformed.

Rev Seth Wispelwey About 8am, those of us called to the front line - about 50 in all - marched from First Baptist church on Main Street to Emancipation Park. For two and a half hours, we sang, prayed, and tried to diffuse tension. We bore witness as groups of men began to march in and the temperature started to rise.

Ez&#233; Amos, freelance photographer At first, everybody was singing and walking peacefully. As we walked there was a gentleman standing there with a white T-shirt. I knew the uniform and took a few photos and made him look up, and I got a nice clean shot of his face. He turned out to be the driver of the car.

Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily Progress I got to Emancipation Park at 9am. The rally wasn't scheduled to begin til noon but there were already hundreds of people arriving at the park. There was so much rhetoric around the media, but I'm a white male so I didn't have it that bad. Ez&#233; is from Africa, he was much more of a target.

Ez&#233; Amos I saw the first wave of alt-right guys march up, led by Eli Mosley. They said some things to me, called me a nigger. An alt-right guy in a Hitler and swastika T-shirt punched me in the face in front of the police. The police did absolutely nothing.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rev Seth Wispelwey, centre, locks arms with other clergy members at the entrance to the park

Rev Seth Wispelwey We were linking arms at the entrance to the park, just like John Lewis and his people did in Selma. We saw a wave coming over the hill, and I thought "This is what we prepared for."

Christian Yingling, Pennsylvania Light Foot Militia The alt-right filed in carrying clubs and shields. They had their baseball batting helmets, chanting "White is right", screaming "History not heritage" and things like that.

Rev Seth Wispelwey They battered through the line of clergy. Then about 500 members of the League of the South and the National Socialist Movement - literal Nazis - came over the crest of Market Street.

Christian Yingling Everybody came together at the same point in the street out in front of the park. The city of Charlottesville knew who was coming to town, they did their homework, so why would you funnel group after group, right and left, right through each other? It made no sense.

Ryan Kelly There were barriers in the park to keep people separate but as people went in everyone got mixed up with everyone else. People were throwing bottles, there was pepper spray burning people's eyes.

Claire Gasta&#241;aga, ACLU Virginia I was on the corner of Second and Market St. It was clear there was no effort to separate the two sides - there was almost permission to engage in violence.

Brennan Gilmore It was pretty clear to me it was not going to end well. The place was awash with weapons and you didn't know who was legitimate security or who was from a militia.

Christian Yingling Thirty-two guys walking down the street in full body armour with semi-automatic weapons, sure, it's going to intimidate people. Was that our intention? No. We are a really community-minded organisation and we are trying to get out of that stereotype that militias are fat guys hiding out in the woods waiting for the government.

Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily Progress The militia groups claimed they were just maintaining the peace, but they were all wearing camo and military gear and carrying rifles and handguns. It added to the sense of hostility.

Emily Gorcenski, local activist The militia didn't do anything to keep the peace. I think they wanted to stand there and roleplay.

Christian Yingling, Pennsylvania Light Foot Militia The reason for us to be there had nothing to do with white supremacy - I completely disagree with their message. But they had the right to say whatever they wanted, and the counter-protesters had that right too, and that's why we were there.

Emily Gorcenski When you look at what these militia groups are saying, it's very rarely in the defence of black people, for example. It's very rarely in the defence of liberals or progressives or socialists. It only seems to be in defence of forces in our society that continue to oppress minorities.

Image caption Christian Yingling of the Pennsylvania Light Foot Militia, at Emancipation Park

Rev Brenda Brown-Grooms I was at the First United Methodist Church. We kept being locked down in the building. There were Nazis shouting outside, Antifa trying to combat them. People in the church were trying to sing over the din. The helicopters were hovering overhead, their rotor blades wapping. We looked at one another and started praying hard.

Dr Michael Williams As the only physician here at UVA who was involved in 9/11 - I was in DC - the feeling of dread I had was exactly the same. That feeling you were being targeted from the outside by people who were outright evil.

Rev Brenda Brown-Grooms There was a narrative that people came to town to stir up trouble, but we have to take that back. Certainly people came to town, but they were also already here. They live here. I see them all the time.

Ryan Kelly There were hundreds, if not thousands, of people around the park at this point. It was tough to keep track.

Rev Seth Wispelwey There were roving groups of men, most in polo shirts, many carrying sticks, bats, all in the street. What was surreal was seeing all the monuments around the city surrounded by hundreds of people intending to cause violence. When we got face to face with these white supremacists, all the slurs were anti-Semitic, homophobic, misogynistic - we didn't hear anything anti-black or anti-Muslim. It was even more primitive.

Christian Yingling Over five and a half hours, we had bricks thrown, people being hurt by clubs, paint and faeces tossed at my people. The majority were from hate groups - they came organised, they had a plan, you could tell by the way they marched. Antifa had their plan too, because they came with coolers full of stuff to throw at people.

Isaac Smith, former Jason Kessler ally Look at who was going to be there, you are putting large radical armed groups - actual Nazis - with actual Communists and you are giving them all guns. That was a recipe for disaster. There were definitely alt-right groups I could see were armed to the teeth. And then you also had the far-left, Redneck Revolt. Most of Charlottesville who were counter-demonstrating were peaceful, but there were a lot of out-of-towners who had wanted to punch a Nazi for their whole lives and finally they had an opportunity.

Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily Progress It was really strange because it was all happening with this giant police presence around the outer edges of the park.

Claire Gasta&#241;aga Nobody predicted that the police would have been as incompetent as they were. It never occurred to us that they wouldn't keep the demonstrators and counter-demonstrators separate.

Nikuyah Walker, counter-protester People were yelling at officers, asking them 'Why didn't you protect us, why didn't you help us?'

Ryan Kelly It got worse and worse until the police finally stepped in and said it was an unlawful assembly, and people started to disperse.

Dr Michael Williams At the hospital we'd had a trickle of people who were faint from the heat, but in the morning we were mainly just watching the TV and listening to the radio communication. Then I heard on the police radio, "Pedestrians struck, multiple victims, potentially as many as 40."

'TIME JUST SEEMED TO STOP'

Saturday afternoon - At the corner of Water Street and Fourth, a white nationalist rally-goer ploughs into a crowd of peaceful counter-protesters in his car, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others. James A Fields, 20, is later arrested and charged with murder.

Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily Progress I was taking photos on Fourth Street and it was calm, it was the calmest I'd felt all day. It was at that exact second when a car sped past me down the street. Out of instinct I grabbed my camera.

Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's mother Heather went off with her friends that day to say "This is our town, get out, this is what we believe, if you don't like it, leave" and to stand strong with her friends in the community to say black lives do matter.

Brennan Gilmore, Charlottesville resident I heard the acceleration of a car behind and looked around and saw a vehicle flying down the street. It was immediately apparent what was going on by the manner he was driving. The visual was horrifying, the sound of it was revolting.

Jack Basile, gave CPR to Heather Heyer At first I thought it was an explosion, because all I could see was people flying through the air and people screaming and people running towards me. I have an audio recording and it's hard to listen to.

Rev Brenda Brown-Grooms We were watching the live news inside the building, and we screamed when we saw the car hit. The spit fired in my mouth.

Emily Gorcenski, local activist We had been tracking threats of violence online so I knew right away it was an attack, not an accident. My thought at that moment was that he was going to pop out and start shooting at people. My instinct was to run towards the car, towards the attacker. I briefly drew my gun so I was ready in case he did come out shooting. Thankfully he didn't.

Image copyright Ryan Kelly/Daily Progress Image caption Ryan Kelly took 80 pictures as the car sped past. He won the Pulitzer Prize for this frame

Jack Basile I saw the car backing up the street then I saw Heather lying on her side. I reached around Heather's head and realised instantly it was bad. Then time just seemed to stop.

Brennan Gilmore It was a terrible, terrible moment and all hell broke loose. People were lying in various states of distress, a woman collapsed in front of me. It occurred to me I had been filming it. I debated whether or not to share it, and my first instinct was not to.

Emily Gorcenski We decided at that point was to leave the scene, because some of us had guns and the best thing to do in that scenario was to get the guns out of the situation.

Jack Basile We pulled Heather out from underneath another guy and she took a deep breath and relaxed. There was a critical care nurse who had arrived beside me. I couldn't feel a pulse, she couldn't feel a pulse, and she said let's start CPR. She was doing compressions and I was using a one-way valve mask to help Heather breathe. After a few minutes the police finally showed up. Then paramedics arrived and took over. I walked across the street and sat on the corner in a state of complete and utter shock.

Dr Michael Williams We were watching the news and saw the car fly through. When Heather Heyer came in, CPR was in progress and then 14 others came in. We occasionally see blunt force trauma victims, but it's never or rarely intentional. And it's very rare that we'd get 10 at once, from the same incident.

Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's mother Heather's best friend called me to tell me that the hospital was looking for the next of kin and I knew if he called me, there was something wrong because he never calls unless something's wrong.

Dr Michael Williams People were brought in covered in swastikas and other symbols I would equate with hate. But in the moment we were just taking care of the patients. You don't see the swastikas. I'm African-American, and afterwards, you realise you have got a person here who literally would just as sooner see you dead. But you remind yourself of why you got into the profession.

Ryan Kelly, photographer, Daily Progress It wasn't until I looked at the pictures in full size that the gravity of it hit me. There was one photo specifically that I thought was the most telling, and that was the one we have all seen, the one that went viral and won the Pulitzer. We didn't publish it initially. I talked to my editor and the other photographer, they went to the company and the lawyer and they said "Let's publish it."

Brennan Gilmore I thought that showing [what I had filmed] was necessary to tell people in Charlottesville "stay away, stay home, the stakes are fatal." It never entered my mind that I would be targeted for sharing it. It wasn't until a day later that I heard about the conspiracy theory, that everything I had seen was a set-up, a propaganda operation. These far-right boards had listed my family members. I went through a hellish week of being targeted by these conspiracy theorists. I had friends I'd grown up with who were accusing me.

Susan Bro I can't begin to tell you how horrendous that day was. They walked me up to the room and the detective told me that she was pronounced dead. I just put down my head and let out an ungodly sound.

Jack Basile I had a really, really difficult time afterwards and it is still with me. I still have my press pass from that day, in a bag, and it still has blood on it.

Susan Bro After Heather died there was a period of time, probably three months at least, and it still happens occasionally, where I'd be walking through town and someone would come up to me and say "I knew Heather and she touched my life."

Three hours after the attack, a Virginia State Police helicopter which was monitoring the rally crashed outside Charlottesville, killing Lieutenant H Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke M M Bates.

'THE PRESIDENT KEPT TALKING AND TALKING'

Tuesday afternoon, New York - President Trump has already made two statements on Charlottesville, first stating on Saturday, to the dismay of many watching, that there was violence "on many sides", before delivering prepared remarks on Sunday in which he condemned white nationalism. At a press conference in New York on Tuesday, he makes his third statement on the violence.

Jordan Fabian, White House correspondent, The Hill The press conference was billed as an announcement on infrastructure and we were told he wasn't planning on taking questions. You never know what's going to happen with him, but we weren't expecting him to wade back into this. He started to wrap up and a reporter shouted out a question and he answered it, and it was off to the races.

Jalane Schmidt, Black Lives Matter activist I was watching TV and I heard Trump say there were "good people on both sides".

Jordan Fabian As he made those remarks, the atmosphere at the press conference got more and more heated. I remember, there was a lot of staff in the lobby of Trump Tower. John Kelly, Trump's chief of staff, was off to one side rubbing his temples. I looked at Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his press secretary, and she was standing there silently. They looked shocked at how it was playing out.

Christine Emba, opinion editor, The Washington Post The hope was that surely, surely the President of the United States would say something appropriate. Say "This is not who we are." Or "Racism is bad", perhaps? That we are against white supremacy? The fact that he could not bring himself to do that was a shocking confirmation that we were in a newly bad place.

Zyahna Bryant, Charlottesville high school student I was in Charlottesville near downtown and I was watching him on the TV with some friends and we were all just like, what? Twitter was blowing up, Facebook and Instagram were blowing up.

Jordan Fabian Just judging from the body language, I think a lot of his staff were uncomfortable with what he was saying. Gary Cohn appeared to be gesturing to the president to wrap it up. Of course the president just kept talking and talking.

Jalane Schmidt There was dismay. To have your president say that - it was mortifying that anybody could dare make any moral equivalency between counter-protesters and these white supremacist haters bent on murder. It was just insulting.

Christian Yingling, Pennsylvania Lightfoot Militia I was standing in the kitchen and I remember the moment he said "There are good people on both sides and bad people on both sides", and then he threw in a little nugget about the one good group that was there. That really caught my ear. I looked at my wife, "Did I just get a nod from the president?" "I think you did," she said.

Jason Kessler, organiser, Unite the Right rally In the environment of sensationalism, and blaming only one side, it was good to hear the president mention that we had a permit. People don't know that.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump's Tuesday press conference at Trump Tower

Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's mother Trump's office called while I was at the funeral and I had my phone turned off. I turned my phone on at 10pm and I saw that there had been three voicemails from the president's office. They sounded increasingly frantic. I turned on the news and heard him say that there were good people on both sides and I thought, I don't want to talk to him.

Christian Yingling It was really like any other protest - there were good people on both sides. Not all the people who went up to the park that day were white supremacists.

Isaac Smith, former Kessler ally It was relatively clumsy, but not fundamentally incorrect. There are better ways he could have made the same point.. There were people on both sides who energetically participated in violence: it's not as simple as 'one side attacked the other and one side defended themselves'.

Jordan Fabian, White House correspondent, The Hill If you compare to previous administrations, I don't think there would be situation where you would have a soft-pedalling reaction to any kind of white supremacist violence. But the president had said what he said the first time, and sort of taken it back. Then when he doubled down on his first response at that press conference at Trump Tower, in such a vehement way, I think that let a lot of people know that's what he truly felt about the situation.

Christine Emba, Washington Post As an African American person living in America, it felt like a double betrayal. First, he couldn't bring himself to admit that it was not "both sides" - that there's a difference between white supremacists and people pushing back against them. Then we had to wait for him to be reined in by a trained communications professional, but he still couldn't stick to that.In the end, he said what he really wanted to say. He was addressing aid and comfort to the people he wanted to reassure, and that was white supremacists and his more racist supporters. He put himself on the side of an America we had hoped we were leaving behind.

Zyahna Bryant What he said really created a ripple effect. I've heard people all over, even within our community, say we have to pay attention to the violence on both sides.

Jordan Fabian I think that still a year later stands out as one of the lowest moments of President Trump's time in office.

Christine Emba And he hasn't done very much since to make anyone feel better. He went from that to deriding the NFL protesters who took a knee, to calling African nations shithole countries, to calling MS-13 members animals. It hasn't gotten better.

'AUGUST 12 WAS NOT THE BEGINNING OR END'

Today - Charlottesville has elected Nikuyah Walker, who was among the counter-protesters in August, as the city's first black woman mayor, and many in the city see progress wrought from the wounds of that weekend. Others see a deep racial inequality laid bare but barely changed by what happened. The Confederate statues still stand, and the city has declared a state of emergency ahead of the anniversary.

Rev Brenda Brown-Grooms I was born in Charlottesville in the basement of the University of Virginia, among the lead-dripping pipes, because that's where the coloured babies were born. I could not have been born at Martha Jefferson hospital. Even if my mother had been crowning with me she would not have been allowed in. There is an ugly truth in Charlottesville and in America, and it is the legacy of white supremacy.

Nikuyah Walker, mayor of Charlottesville Charlottesville has always been a pretty segregated area. I grew up like many black families in the community: working-class families, parents working every day, multiple jobs, attempting to make ends meet. It's a very different experience from the Charlottesville in our brochures and the "world-class city" designation we attempt to give ourselves.

Wes Bellamy, former deputy mayor We used to think we were somehow better than the other communities and cities in which you saw overt white supremacy. Ours was always much more covert and underhanded, it wasn't directly in your face.

Nikuyah Walker I know previous generations - my parents' generation, grandparents - learned to stay out of the way, learned to do what you need to do to get by.

Jalane Schmidt Local white folks tend to think of this as a liberal place but black people - and I am African American - we see a lot of contradictions. The police stopping and frisking black people. The gentrification. The lack of affordable housing. The struggle to get living wage.

Zyahna Bryant, student who wrote the original statue petition There are still unspoken boundaries in Charlottesville, places where people of colour are not welcome. The downtown mall is not a very welcoming space.

Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's mother Have things changed in Charlottesville? It depends on who you ask. If you ask a wealthy white person, the town is wonderful and it has always been wonderful. If you ask someone who is not wealthy and not white, you would get a different perspective. August 12 was not the beginning or the end of the situation here.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Susan Bro, mother of Heather Heyer, standing ahead of the anniversary at the place her daughter was killed

Zyahna Bryant August 12 was only a reflection of the history of Charlottesville and how racist it really is. August 12 is every day. A lot of people want us to move into this "August 13" phase where we move past everything, but we are still in this paralysis of August 12. We are still there.

Ez&#233; Amos, photographer Some things have started to change, in the sense that people talk about the racial divide, inequality. More white people are being outspoken about it, which I really appreciate.

Claire Gasta&#241;aga, ACLU Virginia What happened provoked a sense that we haven't really had the conversations about race in America that we need to have. There's a great need for that. Whether there's the will for it remains an important question.

Wes Bellamy We just took 120 people from Charlottesville on a pilgrimage to Montgomery, Alabama, to learn about civil rights and the history of lynching. We have finally recognised John Henry James, a man who was lynched here in 1898. We put a lynching marker up and gave him his proper due. Those things would not have happened were it not for what occurred that weekend. The legacy is not just about statues and park names, those are ultimately superficial things. There are things happening on the ground that are changing the landscape of the community.

Ryan Kelly, photographer I love this city, but what happened was a scar on Charlottesville. The fact the whole world now knows this place now because of one attack is depressing.

Rev Seth Wispelwey Outside of town, I feel Charlottesville had a really positive impact. But it's been hard to face here because we are continuing to live under the threat of white supremacist violence.

Susan Bro The hate does not seem to disappear, it just keeps changing forms.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Charlottesville's downtown pedestrian mall, on a recent summer day

Walt Heinecke, counter-protest organiser The community in Charlottesville is pretty much ready for whatever happens on the anniversary.

Susan Bro Jason Kessler says he isn't going to do anything here but I wouldn't count on people not showing up.

Jason Kessler I was originally hoping to do something in Charlottesville but we had to drop those plans. I don't think Charlottesville has a commitment to public safety. I think it's better for me and the citizens of Charlottesville to have parted ways, and they can heal from whatever mental wounds they've had from this sordid affair and I can do the same.

Christine Emba, Washington Post I think people of colour were really affected by Charlottesville, by seeing that historical violence dredged into the present. I think many felt isolated by it. You might be surrounded by white neighbours and friends who say, "I'm so sorry for you, but we should move on," and it's a very isolating feeling.

Zyahna Bryant There are people here who continue to deny that racism is even a thing, or that white supremacy is a thing. But white supremacists keep coming to town. Some of them live right here in Charlottesville. We are at a point where it's time to choose a side: either you are going to be on the right side or the wrong side of history.

Wes Bellamy I still get abuse every day. You think white supremacists are going to stop calling me nigger because of something that happened one weekend last year? Or because now I have a doctorate? Now they call me doctor nigger.

When you think about hydrogen and flight, the image that comes to mind for most is the Hindenburg airship in flames.

But in a lab deep in the basement of Imperial College in London, a young team has built what it believes is the future of air travel.

H2Go Power is seeking a patent to store the explosive gas cheaply and safely.

Until now, storing hydrogen required ultra-strong and large tanks which could withstand pressures of up to 10,000 pound-force per square inch (psi). That is hundreds of times greater than what you would find in a car tyre.

But, while studying for her PhD in Cambridge, Dr Enass Abo-Hamed came up with a revolutionary structure which could store hydrogen as a stable solid without compression.

"The pressure involved is similar to what you'd get in a coffee machine," she says.

The university paired her with materials scientist, Luke Sperrin, to try to find commercial applications for the innovation - and H2Go Power was born.

Test flight

Dr Sperrin is now chief technology officer. He and Dr Abo-Hamed formed a partnership with Canadian hydrogen fuel cell maker Ballard a year ago to create a drone which used their reactor to safely store hydrogen for flight.

Finally, after months of collaboration by phone and email, Mr Sperrin and chief product developer Peter Italiano flew to Boston for a ground-breaking test flight.

"Of course you need really good weather to fly a drone," smiles Mr Sperrin.

"And it poured with rain for the first few days. We weren't even sure whether we'd even be able to go ahead.

"So when it did fly, it was a huge relief."

How it works

The aluminium reactor weighs less than a bag of sugar.

The small gas cylinder has an intricate network of 3D-printed aluminium tubes inside.

The hydrogen remains stable and solid in these structures until "coolant" is pumped through the tubes, warming them and releasing hydrogen gas to the drone's fuel cell

Hydrogen (H2) is pumped into one side of the fuel cell through a catalyst which frees electrons, creating electricity.

Oxygen (O) is then pumped into the other side of the fuel cell and combines with the left over, positively-charged hydrogen atoms (H+).

The only final waste product is water vapour (H2O).

Never-ending supply

Until recently, a major hurdle to affordable hydrogen technologies was the cost of producing hydrogen gas.

Splitting water molecules into hydrogen used a lot of energy which usually came from fossil fuel sources.

However, the widespread availability of renewable energy and improvements in electrolysis - the chemical process of separating elements using electricity - have brought down the financial and environmental cost of producing hydrogen for fuel.

Currently most countries have strict safety rules about flying drones over heavily populated areas.

Collision or technical failure could cause a drone to drop out of the sky.

Lithium-ion (Li-on) batteries are highly flammable, so a crash landing could trigger an explosion.

But, Dr Abo-Hamed points out, even if their drone fell out of the sky, the hydrogen would remain stable in its solid form inside the reactor.

Image copyright H2Go Power Image caption Dr Enass Abo-Hamed got the idea for the hydrogen reactor while working on her PhD

Super fuel

"Hydrogen is a happy gas," continues Dr Abo-Hamed. "It wants to move around."

That's what makes it so explosive. But, it also delivers more bang for your buck.

Hydrogen generates three times as much power per kilogram compared to fossil fuels - approximately 39.0 Kilowatt hours per kilogram compared with roughly 13 kWh per kg for kerosene or petrol or just 0.2 kWh for conventional lithium ion batteries.

That means a hydrogen-powered drone can fly further than a battery-powered drone and, potentially, carry heavier loads.

Dr Abo-Hamed is excited about the possibilities for her innovation.

"So if drones could stay longer in the sky, they can deliver medicine," she says. "Or scan a disaster area and send the information back.

"My dream really is not just to make drones.

"Maybe in the next twenty or thirty years we could de-carbonise air travel, which is something really important for our climate."</text><tags>Fuel, Drones</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-51088499<category>uk</category><title>Birmingham cars could be banned from driving through city centre</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Birmingham City Council's transport plan seeks to cut traffic and reduce pollution

Private cars will be banned from taking "through trips" across Birmingham city centre under plans to cut pollution.

Vehicles will be able to drive into the city, but would have to go back out to the ring road to access other areas.

In a newly published transport plan the city council is also looking at rerouting the A38 and bringing in a 20mph limit on more residential roads.

It promotes more public transport use, walking and cycling, but opponents say it could gridlock the city.

What is happening?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The A38 could be rerouted to an "upgraded ring road" and the city's tunnels used for public transport only

The Birmingham Transport Plan lays out a number of changes the council wants to make over the next decade.

Under proposals, no private vehicles would be allowed to travel through the city centre, and could only come in and out from certain areas.

The authority will also look to introduce measures to reduce parking and could also redevelop some of its car parks, while the A38 could be rerouted to an "upgraded ring road" and the city's tunnels used for public transport only.

Public transport would be the "preferred choice" for travelling in and out of the city and city centre streets would be pedestrianised and integrated with public transport.

How would a ban on cars crossing Birmingham work?

If it is backed by the council's cabinet on 21 January, a consultation on the plan will begin on 28 January.

However, it has been criticised by Conservative opposition councillors.

Tory councillor Robert Alden, said plans to close the tunnels "will bring the city to a standstill, destroying jobs and pushing more congestion and pollution to the residential areas on the edge of the ring road."

It comes after multiple warnings Birmingham must clean up its air by this year or face being fined &#163;60m.

From July a Clean Air Zone (CAZ) will be introduced, meaning owners of "non-compliant" cars will pay &#163;8 to drive into the city centre.

Why is it being done?

The plans, which go further than the introduction of the CAZ, are designed to tackle air pollution and a growing population, with the authority saying it wants to improve air quality, health and reduce congestion.

Air pollution is widely regarded as a public health crisis in Birmingham that contributes to 900 premature deaths a year in the city.

The measures are designed to reduce impact on the environment as part of the council's commitment to becoming a carbon-neutral city by 2030, eliminate danger on the roads and revitalise the city centre, the authority said.

What does it mean for drivers?

The changes would have a significant impact on motorists who drive across the city centre.

While people could still drive into the city from certain areas, they would have to drive back out using the surrounding ring road, and journeys straight through the city centre would not be allowed.

There could also be restrictions on lorries making daytime deliveries.

"Cars will no longer be king in the city, public transport systems will become king," said Councillor Waseem Zaffar, the cabinet member for transport and environment.

However, some commuters are sceptical. Caz Dillon, from Marston Green said: "There is absolutely no way on earth that we can do that because our public transport system is so atrocious and so unreliable.

"That is why people drive because you just cannot rely on our train service and until they get that sorted they haven't got a hope in hell to try and ban cars."

Analysis - Kathryn Stanczyszyn, BBC WM political reporter

The car used to be king in Birmingham - the city council says that crown must now be taken by public transport.

By far the biggest headline of these plans is radical changes to how traffic moves through the city centre, with the possibility of the A38 closing to private vehicles, and access in and out allowed only from certain points on the city's ring road.

The Labour-run local authority says it's time to stop tinkering at the edges and make real change to improve air quality.

But critics are concerned that business will be hit hard, and that for the motorist - already braced for a Clean Air Charge and a workplace parking tax - it's a move that's too big to stomach.

What do people think?

Image caption Private cars will only be allowed in and out of Birmingham in certain places, with public transport, walking and cycling to be used to get across the city

Richard Lobban, 36, a truck driver who lives in Moseley, said early starts for his job meant he could not use public transport to get to his depot in Aldridge, Walsall.

He said he and his partner had just put their home up for sale to move further out of Birmingham, but the council's plans meant he would now "only go into the city centre if I'm paid to or told to".

"I see the area they're talking about getting bigger and any charges just getting bigger, so we want to be far enough out for it not to affect us.

"Everyone likes the comfort of their car, I understand that, and something has to be done, but it's only going to get worse on the roads because everyone will be on the same routes."

Claire Longhurst echoed the comments about public transport on the BBC Midlands Facebook page.

"I'm not against making the air cleaner (who is really) but the public transport needs to be sorted out first. You can't force people out of their cars but give them no decent alternative," she said.

What are other towns and cities doing?

Out on the water, crammed into a boat with five members of her family, Amy Savage felt helpless watching a line of orange spread across the sky.

How bad would the fire be? How long would they be stuck out here?

"The scariest thing was not knowing," she says.

Just an hour earlier, she and her family had fled their campground tents as a mammoth blaze swept towards the sleepy Australian coastal town of Mallacoota.

This was not the New Year's Eve they had been anticipating.

Image copyright AMY SAVAGE Image caption Amy Savage on the boat out on the water at Mallacoota

For years, her family, like many others, had ventured to this corner of the nation each summer for an idyllic coastal getaway filled with nature trails, fishing and water-skiing.

Now she feared it was burning to the ground. All around her in the dark, other holidaymakers waited anxiously in their bobbing boats, scanning the foreshore.

Waiting on the shore

On the beach, people lined the water's edge, fearful of the fire front's advance.

Authorities had told reporters there were 4,000 people sheltering on the beach on Tuesday morning but witnesses reported there were only hundreds actually on the sand.

Image copyright PETER HOSKIN Image caption Locals shelter on the beach at Mallacoota on Tuesday morning

The smoke was so toxic that many, including Melbourne couple Raphael Korman, 30 and his wife Yukie, 31, were sheltering in their cars near the foreshore. Yukie, who has a respiratory issue, was struggling to breathe in the smoke.

Their camping trip had been aborted the day before when authorities escalated warnings about a fire set to sweep through the region. The couple debated staying at their camp in the bush, but ultimately heeded the warnings, Mr Korman said.

The long, dark night

So on 30 December, they drove back into Mallacoota - passing closed roads along the way. That night they bunkered down in the holiday park which doubled as the emergency meeting area.

The atmosphere was tense: "You could see this glowing redness that was starting to encroach on the town," Mr Korman said.

The next day he woke up at 08:00 where "everything [was] pitch dark - like the sun forgot to rise. There's no sun - absolutely no light coming from the sky." His eyes watered from the smoke.

The fire had gotten so close to the town by now that its smoke column - a plume as high as 14km into the sky - had completely blacked out the sky.

"This was when we were most anxious," he told told the BBC. "When there was no sun, and everything was just black there was this real feeling of apocalyptic dread. This is otherworldly - not a natural thing to be happening," he said.

The sky stayed black for another hour then changed to blood-red. The fire had arrived in town.

Saving homes

Dominic Van Der Merwe and his brother had stayed behind to defend their father's property on the town's north edge, while the rest of the family fled to the jetty by the shore.

That night they had set alarms every hour to keep an eye out for embers. By 07:30 they were up, hosing down the house and the large garden, keeping things wet. They heard the fire before they saw it.

"It sounded like a jet engine, a far-away plane over the hill that we were on," Mr Van Der Merwe told the BBC.

"Then the first we actually saw of it was when the blackness of the clouds above us started to glow red," - the fire was behind the crest in the hill - where the first line of houses were.

Suddenly, the front burst over the top, hitting a street only 200m away. Gas bottles were "screaming and then exploding".

Embers started to shower down around them, sparking spot fires around their house. Some flared up on their exit route - in the worst case scenario they had planned to escape via their boat at the bottom of the hill.

"That's when it started to get very real - up until that point it was just so eerie but then when there was one below us the whole thing was just adrenalin, you just kept going to put them out."

His family and two others worked for hours to quash fires around their block. The front bypassed their home but destroyed others.

Campground ember attack

A few kilometres south down at the campground by the foreshore, "alarms went off, embers started to fly into town and spot fires were appearing all over," says Mr Korman.

But the response was efficient and measured he said. Those who stayed behind the campground were prepared.

"People weren't panicking - they were composed," he said. "Everyone had buckets of water, they were hosing down their caravans and pouring water on embers as they fell."

"I asked one bloke tackling the embers how he was going and he just sort of flashed a thumbs up, that sort of stoic nature."

Wal Lawson, 69, was one of the people who stayed in the campground to protect the caravans and tents.

"It was certainly scary and what have you, but the adrenalin kicks in and you just run around putting out the embers," he told the BBC.

He and his wife had mapped out an escape route if it came to it - a friend was manning a boat on the water.

"A few times, I have to say, we wondered if we should have just gone in the boat and gone - but I'm glad we stayed back.

"I don't want to overdramatise it- ours was chicken feet compared to what the firefighters were doing up in town - but i think it helped."

Aftermath

By early afternoon, the worst of the threat had passed, helped by a favourable change in wind direction. However, dozens of homes on the town's perimeter were razed. The one road leading out of the town was closed off.

Ms Savage and her family motored back to shore as the sky lifted to orange and then a dirty smoky grey. She feels guilty that the campground survived, while many locals' homes were lost.

Over the following days, police organised airlifts of food, water and other supplies to the cut-off town.

Evacuations via Black Hawk helicopters and naval vessels took place on Thursday and Friday to whisk holidaymakers away from the area.

Mr Lawson's wife, Fran, has joined the naval evacuation - a 20-hour journey back to Melbourne - but he has stayed behind with some friends to help the town cope with the predicted next batch of fires.

"The campers are safe but the townspeople are really spitting and hit hard."

Saturday's conditions are predicted to be even worse than Tuesday's, and while much of the bush around Mallacoota is burnt, the threat still remains.

He and his family have been coming to Mallacoota every Christmas and New Year's break for close to 31 years.

"This devastation - this was like nothing we'd ever seen," he said.

Getting your hands on the latest pair of trainers can be hard, and some people are now turning to technology in an attempt to jump the queue.

Mention the word "bot" to sneakerheads and you'll probably be met with a quiet anger. That's because automated programs are increasingly being used to help people get hold of the latest limited edition kicks.

Popular brands, such as Nike and Adidas, regularly release trainers with celebrity or designer collaborations, often in relatively small numbers and to widespread anticipation.

Buying the latest pair of "hype" trainers can also be lucrative. The right design can be sold for huge mark-ups on secondary sale sites. That's because getting hold of them is often no easy task.

Megabus to London

A few years ago, thousands of people used to descend on a high street shop on big release days, often resulting in scuffles and trouble. But these days sneakerheads have to sign up to apps, be on mailing lists and scour the internet for titbits of information to discover when their desired shoe will hit the market.

Even then, trainer fans are sometimes entered into a raffle by retailers, via social media. In some cases buyers have to prove their fandom with pictures in their favourite pairs. And only then will the winners be allowed into the actual shop. Once there, you'd better hope your size hasn't sold out before you get to the counter.

To bypass all this, some have turned to computer software to buy trainers online. The right bot can be bought off the internet for as little as &#163;20.

They can then can be programmed with a name, address and bank details, so that as soon as that much-anticipated drop is announced, fans can hit go and the program will head to the retailers' systems, often bypassing their security, and buy those sought after trainers.

Without an app you could be stuck in a queue on the website, hitting refresh over and over again.

Image caption Travis Scott Air Jordan 1 Hi OG trainers were dubbed the "trainer of the season"

"Mark", not his real name, says using bots is a "dirty shoe secret". He admitted using one to get his hands on a pair of Jordan 5 trainers after failing to get hold them in the shop.

The 31-year-old from Manchester - who does not want to be named for fear of being blacklisted - said he had signed up for updates about the trainer's release.

"On the Thursday night everyone got an email to say the trainers were going to be dropping in store on the Friday. As soon as I got that email, it was straight online, booked my Megabus ticket down to London."

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption "It's like trainers have been traditionally made for men"

Through the night, more and more people started turning up and the atmosphere changed. He said things started to get aggressive when people began queue jumping.

"In the end I thought there's no point. So I rang a friend who has a pretty decent bot. I offered him an extra &#163;50-&#163;100 to see whether he could get me a pair. On the day, the retail was, I think, &#163;135 or &#163;150. The person that I knew bought 20 pairs and flipped them all for &#163;600 each."

He's not alone. The Travis Scott Air Jordan 1 Hi OG trainers was dubbed the "trainer of the season" by some. Fans could buy a pair in the shops for around &#163;140.

However, the BBC found some for sale at the trainer convention, Crepe City, in London, with a price tag of &#163;1,400. You can find them online for upwards of &#163;2,500.

And getting a bot isn't difficult. The internet is littered with ones specifically designed to help people get the trainers they want. At one point, you could buy a bot that works for one retailer on Apple's app store for just &#163;20.

Image caption Franklin Boateng, otherwise known as "The King of Trainers"

"It is a big problem," says Franklin Boateng, known as "the King of Trainers" because of his collection. He has been collecting trainers for around 20 years but says the big brands have now cottoned on to the practice. He says there is a big market for resale in Asia.

"They haven't got as many of the actual retailers. Some people will buy some women's sizes here. It could be an Adidas Yeezy and they know that a lot of people in Asia will pay a lot of money for it - probably double or triple the amount they would pay in the UK."

George Sullivan runs The Sole Supplier, a website dedicated to discussing all things trainers. "Generally, resellers will get banned from retailers, if they're known, because the brands just don't like it," he says.

"They want people to be able to wear their shoes. It's just like people reselling tickets for concerts. It's not fair."

Image caption This bot could be bought online for less than &#163;20

He says teenagers as young as 13 with coding knowledge are the ones behind some of the most sophisticated bots on the market.

One sophisticated bot was recently being sold for about &#163;1,500 because it was so good at buying shoes. He added that the buzz around the release of the bot reminded him of the release of a rare pair of shoes.

"There was a limited release of it and people were reselling the bot because it was so successful."

Reebok says it is trying to block bots to be able to give fans a fair chance of getting their hands on their trainers. The firm said it was an "ever-changing landscape" and resellers were "constantly finding new methods of beating the system".

It said it had a "dedicated team tasked with ensuring our technology is as bulletproof as possible".

Meanwhile, Adidas said: "We will often limit purchases to one pair per consumer to allow each fan an equal and fair chance to get hold of limited edition designs."

Nike did not respond to our request for a statement, while Asics said it does not have an official comment at this stage.

Image caption Trainer manufacturers say they have dedicated teams to tackle the issue

However, Mark says the resale side has kicked up a notch. He says he knows more than a dozen 18-year-olds who are using bots to buy and resell trainers. Most do it to bump up their spending money.

"If they know there's a hype behind the shoe, it doesn't matter how ugly it is or how rare it is, as long as there is a hype, they will go for it.

"It could also be a jacket, or a watch, it could be jumpers and hoodies. As long as there's a market for it, and they know there's going to be a profit in it, they'll go after it."

While the smartphone giants are trying to make their devices fold and encourage the use of wireless headphones, this US start-up is focused on delivering a shape that it says is more "sensual" and has built in two headphone jacks.

The project dates back to 2015 and has yet to get its software to match its form, but the company suggests the phone will finally launch in about a year's time.

Arnold Schwarzenegger means it when he says: "I'll be back," but not everyone is thrilled there's a new Terminator film out this week.

In labs at the University of Cambridge, Facebook and Amazon, researchers fear Terminator: Dark Fate could mislead the public on the actual dangers of artificial intelligence (AI).

AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio told BBC News he didn't like the Terminator films for several reasons.

"They paint a picture which is really not coherent with the current understanding of how AI systems are built today and in the foreseeable future," says Prof Bengio, who is sometimes called one of the "godfathers of AI" for his work on deep learning in the 1990s and 2000s.

"We are very far from super-intelligent AI systems and there may even be fundamental obstacles to get much beyond human intelligence."

Image copyright Maryse Boyce Image caption AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio thinks we're still a long way off super-intelligent machines

In the same way Jaws influenced a lot of people's opinions on sharks in a way that didn't line up with scientific reality, sci-fi apocalyptic movies such as Terminator can generate misplaced fears of uncontrollable, all-powerful AI.

"The reality is, that's not going to happen," says Edward Grefenstette, a research scientist at Facebook AI Research in London.

While enhanced human cyborgs run riot in the new Terminator, today's AI systems are just about capable of playing board games such as Go or recognising people's faces in a photo. And while they can do those tasks better than humans, they're a long way off being able to control a body.

"Current state-of-the-art systems would not even be able to succeed in controlling the body of a mouse," says Prof Bengio, who cofounded the Canadian AI research company Element AI.

Today's AI agents struggle to excel at more than one task, which is why they're often referred to as "narrow AI" systems as opposed to "general AI".

Image copyright University of Cambridge Image caption Neil Lawrence, a machine learning professor at the University of Cambridge, thinks we should reconsider what we call AI

But it would be more appropriate to call a lot of today's AI technology "computers and statistics", according to Neil Lawrence, who recently left Amazon and joined the University of Cambridge as the first DeepMind professor of machine learning.

"Most of what we're calling AI is really using large computational capabilities combined with a lot of data, to unpick statistical correlations," he says.

Individuals such as Elon Musk have done a good job of scaring some into thinking Terminator could become a reality in the not so distant future, thanks in part to phrases such as AI is "potentially more dangerous than nukes".

But the AI community is unsure how quickly machine intelligence will advance during the next five years, let alone the next 10 to 30 years.

There's also scepticism in the community about whether AI systems will ever achieve the same level of intelligence as humans, or indeed whether this would be desirable.

"Typically, when people talk about the risks of AI, they have in mind scenarios whereby machines have achieved 'artificial general intelligence' and have the cognitive abilities to act beyond the control and specification of their human creators," Dr Grefenstette says.

"With all due respect to people who talk of the dangers of AGI and its imminence, this is an unrealistic prospect, given that recent progress in AI still invariably focuses on the development of very specific skills within controlled domains."

We should be more concerned with how humans abuse the power AI offers, Prof Bengio says.

How will AI further enhance inequality? How will AI be used in surveillance? How will AI be used in warfare?

The idea of relatively dumb AI systems controlling rampant killing machines is terrifying.

Prof Lawrence says: "The film may make people think about what future wars will look like."

And Prof Bryson says: "It is good to get people thinking about the problems of autonomous weapons systems."

But we don't need to look into the future to see AI doing damage. Facial-recognition systems are being used to track and oppress Uighurs in China, bots are being used to manipulate elections, and "deepfake" videos are already out there.

"AI is already helping us destroy our democracies and corrupt our economies and the rule of law," according to Joanna Bryson, who leads the Bath Intelligent Systems group, at the University of Bath.

Thankfully, many of today's AI researchers are working hard to ensure their systems have a positive impact on people and society, focusing their efforts on areas such as healthcare and climate change.

Over at Facebook, for example, researchers are trying to work out how to train artificial systems that understand our language, follow instructions, and communicate with us or other systems.

"Our primary goal is to produce artificial intelligence that is more cooperative, communicative, and transparent about its intentions and plans while helping people in real-world scenarios," Dr Grefenstette says.

Ultimately, the responsibility of communicating the true state of AI lies with the media.

The choice of a photo directly affects interest in an article but journalism schools around the world would strongly advise against misleading the public for the sake of clicks.

Unfortunately, there have been numerous instances of outlets using stills from the Terminator films in stories about relatively incremental breakthroughs.

Prof Bryson says she skips over them like adverts, while Prof Lawrence says he assumes they're clickbait.

Journalists writing AI stories "should show the cubicles of the people actually developing the AI", at Google or Facebook, for example, Prof Bryson says.

"The press needs to stop treating AI like some kind of unearthed scientific discovery dug out of the ground or found on Mars," she says. "AI is just a technology that people use to do things."

And she makes a fair point. But be honest, would you have clicked on this story if it didn't have a killer robot photo?</text><tags>Facebook, Amazon, University of Cambridge</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51073884<category>uk</category><title>Student rape reports: The battle to be believed</title><text>Video

Three women who reported being violently sexually assaulted by fellow students &#8211; including one woman who says she was bitten and left with bruises &#8211; have told the BBC the perpetrators got away with it.

A number of UK universities say they are taking action to improve safety on campus but, as reports of sexual misconduct at universities rise, questions remain about how seriously the issue is being taken.

Harvey Weinstein is about to go on trial - and 12 men and women in New York will be responsible for determining whether he is guilty.

Jury selection is currently under way, with the former Hollywood producer accused of five charges, including rape and predatory sexual assault relating to two alleged victims.

But finding impartial juries for such a high-profile case - one that galvanised the #MeToo movement across the world - could be difficult.

The court has summoned 2,000 potential jurors for the case - about five times more than normal - just to find 12 suitable regular jurors and six alternate jurors.

And on the very first day of jury selection, a third of the potential jurors present were dismissed outright, after telling the judge they did not think they could be impartial.

"The first few days of jury selection has already underscored just how challenging it's going to be," Valerie Hans, a law professor and jury expert at Cornell University says.

"When you have large numbers of people saying they can't be impartial, it's a wakeup call - because most people think of themselves as generally fair."

Why is juror selection particularly difficult this time?

Jury selection often takes no more than a few hours, or a day or two.

But the process can be much more drawn out, particularly in high-profile trials. In the O.J. Simpson murder trial, it took almost 11 weeks for a jury to be selected.

The judge in the Harvey Weinstein trial has allocated two weeks for jury selection, while the entire trial is expected to last up to two months - which means many potential jurors will be put off by the amount of time required.

And in this case, "claims have been made against Weinstein by very high profile, high visibility people" - there has been "extensive publicity" and a high number of claims against him, which could make jury selection even more difficult, Prof Hans said.

Xorje Olivares, who attended the court on 8 January as a prospective juror, was one of the dozens of people who ruled themselves out.

He told the BBC his support for the #MeToo movement, and the fact he knew several people who were sexual assault survivors, meant he felt he could not be impartial.

"I personally felt nothing but disgust... even being in the same room as him, I just felt very icky," Mr Olivares, who hosts a radio show, said. "I knew that I had these biased views, and I would bring them to the case."

On the other hand, supermodel Gigi Hadid - who had also reported for jury duty - told the court she could remain impartial, despite having met Weinstein and actress Salma Hayek, one of the trial's potential witnesses.

Hadid, who lives in Manhattan and studied criminal psychology, told the judge she would "keep an open mind on the facts" if selected - but she was dismissed on Thursday, 16 January, as the jury pool was whittled down.

How is the jury being selected - and what sort of jurors will Weinstein's lawyers want?

Although it's known as jury selection, it's actually a process of elimination.

Many prospective jurors are being dismissed from the outset - either because they say they cannot be impartial, or because they have scheduling conflicts.

Those remaining are asked to complete a questionnaire, where they are asked about their education, prior jury service, whether they know people working in the entertainment industry, and whether they have been a victim of physical or sexual abuse.

Then, lawyers for both sides can question them in court, and get potential jurors dismissed if the judge agrees that they are not impartial - this is known as a challenge for cause.

In the US, lawyers are also allowed to remove a number of potential jurors without giving a reason (known as a peremptory challenge), as long as it isn't on the basis of ethnicity or gender.

Peremptory challenges are controversial to some - the UK abolished them in 1988 - because critics believe that lawyers can try to skew juries in a particular way and a randomly selected jury is fairer.

However, in the US, they're considered an important part of the constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury.

In Mr Weinstein's trial, lawyers on each side are allowed to dismiss up to 20 potential regular jurors, says Prof Hans. Lawyers from both sides will try to establish a jury that they believe will be more favourable to their side.

The prosecution will want jurors who can relate to the alleged victims, while the defence will want jurors who "see themselves as the defendant", says Thaddeus Hoffmeister, a law professor at the University of Dayton.

He believes the prosecution may want to select younger jurors, due to their understanding of the #MeToo movement.

He adds that Mr Weinstein is "in a unique position" that "a lot of people will have difficulty relating to".

"You really would need a jury of CEOs, or people who have been in position of power."

What sorts of strategies could the lawyers use?

Mr Weinstein's team has employed a jury consultant - an expert who will assist the lawyers with jury selection, including through community surveys and developing profiles of favourable and unfavourable jurors.

They are also likely to search public social media postings from all prospective jurors to see whether they have commented on the #MeToo movement - although they are not allowed to "friend" jurors.

"Each side will have an ideal juror they're looking for," says Alan Tuerkheimer, a jury consultant. However, they cannot be too obvious about who they want - because if it's clear they want a potential juror, the other side would "probably strike them out".

Instead, he likens it to a "chess game" - where each side tries to guess which jurors are good for their opposition, and then dismiss them.

"The defence are going to want jurors who believe women sometimes make things up to get powerful men in trouble... the prosecution will want people who think that any questioning of the account of victims is off limits."

Prof Hans says the questionnaire results, and online research, can often help lawyers "identify in advance people who will be close minded to their case".

This is particularly useful if it lets them ask the potential jurors questions that demonstrate to the judge that they are not impartial - because then they can be dismissed by a "challenge for cause", without the lawyers using up one of their peremptory challenges.

Finally, with any high-profile trial, there is also the risk of "stealth jurors" - potential jurors with an agenda, or who hope to write a tell-all book afterwards.

"If someone seems too eager to get on a jury, all parties should be careful," Mr Tuerkheimer says, adding that this has led to retrials in the past.

What is it like serving on a high-profile trial?

In the US, the names of jurors are often publicly available - and former jurors have faced intense media attention, or fallen out with family and friends who disagree with their verdict.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey Weinstein's trial has attracted protesters

James Matsumoto, who was jury foreman in the first corruption trial of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, remembered that the court room was packed with journalists when he was questioned as a potential juror.

"There must have been several hundred people on the courtroom at the time. It was a little unnerving, because you don't have anyone there with you in the jury box - you're alone and handed a microphone so that everyone in the court room can hear what you have to say."

He believes that the high-profile nature of the trial helped focus the minds on the jury, because it made them aware of how important the case was.

One unexpected consequence was the fact that "most people gained weight" during the trial, which lasted nearly two months.

Jurors were sequestered during the day, and had to eat lunch together in court, which meant "you're not getting very much exercise, and it's all fast food because you need something quick and near the court house".

He was surprised to find that journalists were even interested in finding out where the jury ordered lunch - considering it a "coup" when they were able to publish their lunch choices.

But the media attention became "really intense" once the trial ended - with the jury finding Blagojevich guilty on one count, but unable to reach an unanimous verdict on 23 other charges.

On his way home, he noticed "a whole bunch of people standing in front of my house".

He said a reporter approached him, asking if he was James Matsumoto - and he tried to divert him by saying "no, I think he lives down the block" - but ultimately he was still recognised.

"That night the phone kept ringing and the answering machine became full. My wife wasn't expecting anything like that, so she was very upset with all the attention," he said.

Other jury members had journalists knocking at their doors - while one found a helicopter hovering over their home.

The trial made a lasting impression on Mr Matsumoto. To this day, he says it bothers him that his jury was not able to reach a consensus on the charges. (At a retrial a year later, Blagojevich was found guilty of 17 charges, and sentenced to 14 years in jail.)

Despite this, Mr Matsumoto says if asked to be a juror again, he would. "For me it was a good experience - I learned more about human nature than I did before, and the nature of truth."

"Most Americans don't want to serve on trials - but I think it's our duty as citizens to be jurors."

His advice to jurors in the Harvey Weinstein trial is simple: "Do everything the judge instructs, just pay attention, and deliberate with honesty."</text><tags>Harvey Weinstein trial, Harvey Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein trial, United States</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47141900<category>world</category><title>Dutch mystery of '20,000 seabird deaths' on coast</title><text>Image copyright Sytske Dijksen/Foto Fitis Image caption The dead guillemots have been washing up along 300km of Dutch coastline

Scientists are trying to find out why some 20,000 guillemots have died in recent weeks along the Dutch coast.

The birds were all emaciated and there are fears they may have been victims of a spill from the MSC Zoe container ship, from which some 345 containers fell in the sea during a storm.

"There's no smoking gun, but we're looking into it," says Mardik Leopold, who is investigating the deaths.

Chemicals may be to blame as most plastics are hard to ingest, he says.

Hours after the containers fell off the MSC Zoe in a storm, they started washing up on islands off the Dutch north coast on 2 January, spilling their contents of children's toys, furniture and televisions on to the beaches.

A bag of peroxide powder was also found.

Why were so many birds affected?

Mardik Leopold, a seabird expert from Wageningen University, said the figure of 20,000 dead guillemots was based on educated guesswork.

"That's based on the average trending rate of one guillemot per kilometre of beach per day in the Netherlands with 300km [186 miles] available. That's 10,000 birds," he told the BBC. A similar number would have been left in the sea, he added.

Image copyright De Fugelhelling Image caption Some of the survivors are being nursed back to health at the F&#251;gelhelling centre

Although he is keeping an open mind, he points out that the birds began washing up at the time of the container spill. Bad weather can also affect a guillemot's access to food, but Mr Leopold believes the problem would then not have been confined to the Dutch coast.

While the guillemots may have swallowed plastic pellets, a spill of paraffin or palm oil was perhaps more likely. The island of Terschelling, where much of the MSC Zoe debris washed up, has also seen paraffin appear on its beaches.

On Wednesday, Dutch authorities said that at least 345 containers had fallen off the ship, 54 more than first thought.

Image copyright Mardik Leopold Image caption Dr Leopold found this guillemot on a beach on the island of Texel this week

Post-mortem examinations will be carried out on 100 of the birds to assess what caused their deaths.

How many have survived?

Dozens of guillemots have been rescued and are being cared for in a number of centres, where many are being fed by tube as they are so weak.

At Uretep in the north of the Netherlands, 11 guillemots are being nursed back to health.

"We have washed seven of them but the other four need to gain weight before we can give them a wash," says Hetty Sinnema from the F&#251;gelhelling centre.

Image copyright De Fugelhelling Image caption The hope eventually is to return the guillemots to the sea when they are strong enough

She says the problem lies in their intestines but believes it is too early to blame the sea container spill for the disaster.

"We tube-feed them with a lot of minerals, energy powder and fish. They now weigh around 600g but they need to be at least 900g before they are strong enough to be washed."

The surviving birds have a long journey to recovery but ultimately the centre hopes they can be returned to the sea.</text><tags>Seabirds, Ocean pollution, Netherlands, Guillemots</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51008819<category>technology</category><title>Ricky Gervais slams Apple over Chinese factories</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images

Apple became the target of Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais during his opening monologue on Sunday night.

Gervais, hosting the ceremony for the fifth and final time, criticised the company's working conditions.

The technology giant's drama series The Morning Show, which airs on Apple TV, had been "made by a company who runs sweatshops in China", he joked.

Among the famous faces in the audience was Apple chief executive Tim Cook. BBC News has approached Apple for comment.

"Apple roared into the TV game with The Morning Show, a superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing the right thing, made by a company that runs sweatshops in China," Gervais said.

The British comedian then addressed the audience directly, condemning those who had worked with large companies such as Apple and its technology rival Amazon.

Presenter Sacha Baron Cohen also got in a jibe about another technology giant when he called out Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.

"The hero of this next movie is a naive, misguided child who spreads Nazi propaganda and only has imaginary friends," said the comedian, presenting an award for which the film Jojo Rabbit had been nominated. "His name is Mark Zuckerberg."

Apple was criticised last year after a report by a campaign group claimed working conditions at an iPhone factory in China were illegal.

According to the report, Foxconn workers were not receiving bonuses and having to do overtime and too many temporary workers were being hired.

Under Chinese law, only 10% of a workforce can be temporary.

Apple later admitted the number of temporary staff "exceeded [its] standards" but denied the other claims.

Similar claims were also made against Amazon, who said it would investigate the number of teenage interns working long hours to manufacture Echo devices.</text><tags>Golden Globes, Golden Globes, Amazon, Apple, Ricky Gervais</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51132764<category>world</category><title>Smog in southern Europe sparks car bans and street protests</title><text>Image copyright Reuters Image caption Demonstrators in Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, want the government to take action pollution

Cities across southern Europe are experiencing dangerously high levels of smog caused by a prolonged period of dry sunny weather and light winds.

Temporary bans on diesel vehicles have been ordered in major Italian cities, including the capital, Rome, in an effort to reduce the pollution.

In Bosnia-Herzegovina, protesters have taken to the streets in gas masks demanding action from the government.

Environmentalists have described the situation as a smog emergency.

In Rome, diesel cars, vans and motorbikes have been banned during peak times, while other polluting vehicles have been banned altogether.

The restrictions, which are set to remain in place over the next three days, are expected to affect about one million vehicles.

At least nine of the 13 areas in Rome that monitor particulate matter - a fine dust known as PM10 - have recorded levels this week in excess of the legal limit, Italy's Il Messaggero reported.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Air quality monitoring stations in Rome have recorded high levels of harmful particulates

Environmentalist groups have complained that Rome city council has been too slow to act on the reported results.

Further north, where air pollution is typically worse, Milan, Turin and Bologna are among other cities to take similar action after recording a sharp rise in particulate matter.

Italy's permitted limit for PM10 particles is 50 micrograms per cubic metre, but in recent days that limit has been exceeded - especially in the north, where monitoring stations near Bologna show levels as high as 125 micrograms per cubic metre.

A high concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 particles can pose significant health risks because they are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs. The most common source is vehicle engine emissions.

Meanwhile, protests have been taking place in cities and towns across Bosnia-Herzegovina.

On Wednesday, hundreds of people wearing respirators and face-masks gathered in the northern city of Tuzla to demand urgent action to improve air quality.

In the capital, Sarajevo, government officials have been holding emergency meetings to discuss measures to curb the pollution.

An "episode of alarm" was declared at the weekend and a ban was put in place to reduce the number of vehicles on the roads.

Local residents have also been advised to head for the mountains, where the air is cleaner, with cheap tickets made available for cable cars.

Further meetings are due to be held on Friday.

Sarajevo is among the cities to record some of the worst levels of air pollution in recent days, along with the capital cities of neighbouring Serbia, Kosovo and Macedonia.

In Serbia, where the government held an emergency meeting on Wednesday, residents were warned to remain indoors and avoid physical activity - especially those with health conditions such as asthma.

Serbia's Prime Minister Ana Brnabic blamed household heating and older diesel cars for the high pollution levels.

Ms Brnabic said measures to tackle the issue would include more and stricter checks on vehicle emissions, improving and replacing filters on power stations and in the longer term, a programme of tree-planting.

Utah Governor Gary Herbert has halted the distribution of 100,000 condoms for free in the US state because of racy slogans on the packaging.

It features phrases like "SL,UT", a word play on Utah and its capital, Salt Lake City, "Enjoy Your Mountin" and "Explore Utah's caves".

It was part of a campaign by the Utah department of health on HIV prevention and promotion of safe sex.

The department apologised for "the offensive packaging".

The office of Mr Herbert, a Republican, said that he "understands the importance of the Utah department of health conducting a campaign to educate Utahns about HIV prevention".

"He does not, however, approve the use of sexual innuendo as part of a taxpayer-funded campaign, and our office has asked the department to rework the campaign's branding," the statement added.

In response, the health department tweeted that "the designs did not go through necessary approval channels", urging any organisation involved in the campaign to immediately stop distributing the condoms.

The department stressed that it remained committed to "running a campaign to help in the prevention of HIV" and intended to do so "in a manner that better respects taxpayer dollars".

It had planned to distribute the condoms through a number of health centres in the western US state.

HIV is a virus that gradually destroys the immune system of the infected person.

Although medicines may help to reduce the symptoms, currently there is no cure.

Kolomna has many stunning sights.

This ancient Russian town has its own Kremlin and a myriad of onion domes from monasteries and churches.

But what catches my eye is an ordinary nine-storey apartment block by the railway station.

I say ordinary. But that was before someone painted a giant mural of Vladimir Putin on the side of the building.

On Apartment Block 25 on Polyanskaya Street, President Putin is half naked, wearing only a towel, and sporting bulging muscles. He is depicted holding up the world, rather like Atlas the Titan from Greek mythology who held the celestial heavens.

Atlas was famed for his endurance. So is Mr Putin: he's been in power in Russia for 20 years. The residents of Apartment Block 25 appear in no hurry to see him go.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Putin visited a perinatal centre in Kolomna two years ago

"Putin has made Russia's position in the world stronger," Vladimir tells me. "Let him have another 10 years in office."

"I was 10 when Putin came to power," says Ilya. "Now I'm 30. I can't really imagine any another leader."

"We live badly," admits Tatyana, "but at least the world takes notice of Putin."

'There will be war anyway'

At the Patriotic Youth Centre across town, high school students are being shown a film about a local hero. Vasily Zaitsev was an ace fighter pilot in World War Two, twice awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.

Image caption A statue of World War Two Russian fighter pilot Vasily Zaitsev sits in the middle of the town

President Putin has made the Soviet victory in World War Two a key element of Russia's national idea.

But as I'm about to discover, there is a fine line between patriotism and nationalism.

Vyacheslav Burilov, the former head of the Kolomna Flying Club (Helicopter Section) gets up to make a speech.

"Unfortunately, our country, the USSR, was destroyed," he tells the young audience.

"And much of Russia's land went to other countries, which is not right. Like Ukraine, Belarus, parts of the Baltic states and part of Kazakhstan. You must make sure this land is returned to Greater Russia. And don't be scared if you hear people say, 'There mustn't be war.' There will be war anyway."

The students respond with applause.

I follow the group as they walk through the slushy streets of Kolomna to Vasily Zaitsev's monument and lay red carnations. Mr Burilov from the Flying Club is there. Astonished by his call to arms, I approach him.

"What you're calling for," I tell him, "means a major war."

Image caption Vyacheslav Burilov, the former head of the Kolomna Flying Club

"It won't be a big war," he assures me. "We have nuclear weapons. If our authorities are decisive and strong, our opponents won't want to fight."

A man called Alexander joins our conversation and starts to criticise the authorities.

"The only time they think of us is when they need our taxes, our votes, or cannon fodder for their wars. There are so many negative things."

Hearing my accented Russian, he suddenly goes quiet.

"Just a minute, are you a citizen of Russia?" he asks.

"No, I'm British."

"In that case, there's no point in me spouting on," concludes Alexander. "Just so you know, we love Russia, we love our country. We are patriots!"

For some in Kolomna the more important battles are closer to home.

Image caption A landfill in Kolomna was recently shut after protests

Local activist Vyacheslav Yegorov takes me to a landfill on the edge of Kolomna. Concerned by its overuse and the noxious smell, campaigners fought hard to get the dump shut.

Its closure is a victory for people power. But only partially. In connection with the protests Vyacheslav is facing criminal charges. Russia's leading human rights group, Memorial, has concluded that the case against him is politically motivated.

Vyacheslav claims that Russia's FSB intelligence service had tried to weaken the protests by attempting to discredit him.

"They claimed I was working for the US State Department and that I had billions stashed away in Swiss bank accounts," he tells me.

Image caption Some Pensioners, many of which are struggling, have to queue up for soup

Back in town I head to the Church of St John the Apostle, where a priest is reciting prayers in the soup kitchen.

For the two dozen pensioners queuing up here, the only battle they are waging - in difficult economic circumstances - is for their own survival.

"My gas and electricity have been cut off," Olga tells me. "I have no money to pay the bills. My pension doesn't cover it. And as for prices in the shops, everything is so expensive."

Olga tells me it's not just the free meals that bring her to church. She comes here to pray.

Image caption A church in Kolomna

For in Kolomna the power of prayer is legendary. According to one story, when the town was attacked by foreign invaders, hundreds of years ago, the townsfolk took refuge in a church. When they prayed for help, the ground opened and the church and parishioners were hidden underground, while the church bells inspired the local soldiers to keep fighting.

In today's Russia, part of the population are counting on their president to make life better. Others have decided they can only rely on themselves.

And some Russians are still hoping for a miracle.</text><tags>Russia, Vladimir Putin</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46393501<category>world</category><title>Southwest Airlines apologises for mocking girl's name</title><text>Image copyright Reuters Image caption The airline issued a "sincere apology" to the girl and her family

Southwest Airlines has apologised after a member of its staff mocked a five-year-old girl's name.

Traci Redford and her daughter, Abcde (pronounced ab-si-dee), were en route home to El Paso, Texas, from California's John Wayne Airport when the incident occurred.

A gate agent allegedly began laughing and took a photo of the child's boarding pass and posted it online.

Airline spokesperson Chris Mainz offered the family a "sincere apology".

In a statement to Buzzfeed News, Mr Mainz said the employee's social media post "is not indicative of the care, respect, and civility" the airline expects.

"We take great pride in extending our Southwest hospitality to all of our customers," the statement reads.

Ms Redford told broadcaster ABC7 that the airline "hadn't done anything" for two weeks after she had filed a formal complaint.

Ms Redford said the gate agent "started laughing, pointing at me and my daughter, talking to other employees", and her daughter had asked her why they were mocking her.

"She said: 'Mom, why is she laughing at my name?' And I said not everyone is nice and not everyone is going to be nice and it's unfortunate," Ms Redford said.

Vocativ, a news and data website, published a piece in 2014 saying there were at that time 328 children in the US named "Abcde", according to the Social Security Administration.

The Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has defended his government's stand on climate change as the country deals with devastating fires and a historic heatwave.

Mr Morrison said his policies on reducing emissions would ensure what he called a "vibrant and viable economy, as well as a vibrant and sustainable environment."

Australia is one of the world's biggest per capita greenhouse gas emitters, and there's been a long-running debate about the country's approach to climate change.

So what is it doing to reduce emissions?

What targets does it have?

Under the Paris Climate Agreement to tackle rising global temperatures, Australia set a target for 2030 of making a 26-28% reduction in its emissions compared with 2005 levels.

These goals have been criticised for being too low, and last year the United Nations (UN) reported that Australia was not on track.

Getty Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets.

The UN found that: "There has been no improvement in Australia's climate policy since 2017 and emission levels for 2030 are projected to be well above the target."

About half of the G20 countries (those with the biggest economies), including Australia, are falling short.

The Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 57 countries responsible for more than 90% of greenhouse gas emissions on climate policy.

It highlighted the country's no-show at a UN climate summit in September and its withdrawal from an international fund to tackle climate change.

The opposition Labor Party in Australia has said the government is "refusing to act" on climate change.

However, the Australian government maintains it is on course to meet its 2030 commitments. "Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets," according to Australian PM Scott Morrison.

Australian emissions will be only 16% lower than 2005 levels in 2030, according to projections published in December.

But it says it will meet the 2030 targets by counting the quantities of carbon already reduced under the previous international climate agreement, the Kyoto Protocol.

Biggest exporters of coal (In million tonnes, 2018)

More important than specific targets - Australia as a fossil fuel producer has so far failed to acknowledge the need to plan for a world of net zero emissions, says Myles Allen, a climate change expert at the University of Oxford.

Net zero means balancing carbon emissions with carbon removal.

The coal industry

Australia is among the world's largest exporters of iron ore, uranium, coal and natural gas.

It was the fourth largest producer of coal in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency.

Phasing out coal is considered crucial to limiting global warming to within 1.5C, but the Australian government is continuing to back the industry for the role it plays in the economy.

Facing criticism over his handling of the bushfires and response to climate change, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said he will not make "reckless" cuts to the coal industry.

The government recently approved the construction of a controversial new coal mine - which could be the biggest in the world and would export coal to India.

What are some of the government's climate policies?

A central climate plan is the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF).

The government put forward an additional A$2bn (&#163;1bn) spread over 15 years to help businesses and farmers reduce emissions, bringing up total investment to $4.5bn. The government says it will deliver 100 million tonnes of emissions reductions.

Though aspects of the ERF have been praised, "Australia has adopted a piecemeal approach to emission reduction," said the OECD (an economic body which monitors richer, industrialised nations) in a 2019 report.

The government needs to show how existing instruments, such as the ERF, can be scaled up to reach Paris Agreement goals, added the report.

Scientists round the world are looking aghast at the politics of climate change in Australia.

It's one of the most vulnerable countries on the planet to rising temperatures, yet there is still denial about the impacts of rising CO2 levels on events like the current wildfires.

There is no serious doubt among scientific institutions that rising global temperatures are leading to record heat.

The heatwaves are driven by a natural phenomenon but they are adding to an already over-heated planet.

In the election, the victorious Liberal (conservative) Party categorised climate change as a metropolitan fad for urban professionals, and gained support for the world's biggest coal mine.

Coal is the dirtiest fuel and scientists say we shouldn't be building more coal-fired power stations if we want to stabilise the climate.

In between the frontrunners during the Democratic debate on Tuesday stood Tom Steyer. You might have spotted him: he was the candidate caught in the middle as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren clashed off-mic at the end.

It was the most intriguing moment of the debate, but if you looked closer, you might have been intrigued even further.

On Mr Steyer's left hand was a symbol, crudely drawn in pen: one large cross with a smaller cross in each quadrant.

It was not the first time the billionaire hedge-fund manager has been seen with it in public - he's drawn it every day for at least two years - but this debate introduced the symbol to a new audience once again.

What is the symbol?

A symbol with five crosses like this is known as a Jerusalem Cross, and it was employed as the symbol of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from the 13th Century. The kingdom was established by crusading European Christians who invaded and conquered Muslim lands.

There is not one agreed meaning to the five crosses - various theories suggest they could represent Christ and the four gospels, five wounds suffered by Christ on the cross, or the four points of the compass.

The original symbol is likely to pre-date even the Kingdom of Jerusalem and was used in feudal states in what is now the country of Georgia, which since 2004 has used the five crosses on its national flag.

Why does Tom Steyer use it?

In an interview with BuzzFeed last year, before he announced he would run for president, Mr Steyer was asked about the significance of the cross on his hand.

"It means to tell the truth no matter what the cost is," he said. "For a while now, I have drawn it on my hand every day to remind myself to always tell the truth. I later discovered that it has traditionally been known as a Jerusalem cross."

Image caption Tom Steyer in a BBC interview in June 2019 - with the mark on his hand

He appears to have started drawing the symbol in the winter of 2017, and in May 2018, he told Politico it was a reminder to always tell the truth, even if you are put on the cross for it.

He also said it was the international sign of humility, although this is not established as a thing.

Mr Steyer - a long-term Democratic donor - is Christian, and this month told a podcast that he was 30 when he found God. But he has not drawn a link between his faith and the symbol on his hand.

Instead, his drive to "tell the truth" is tied to a political group he launched in October 2017, named Need to Impeach, that focused on removing President Donald Trump from office.

It's a message the 62-year-old has repeated since entering the race for the presidency last July. He has also condemned corporate interests that affect government policy, and vowed to declare a state of climate emergency on day one of his presidency, were he to be elected.

Who else uses it?

In recent years, images and terms associated with the Crusades in the Middle East have been appropriated by white supremacists.

When a white supremacist shot dead 50 people in mosques in Christchurch in New Zealand in March last year, his so-called manifesto was reported to include references to the Crusades.

Image copyright NurPhoto via Getty Image caption White supremacists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, where an altered Jerusalem Cross was seen (far right)

Banners depicting the Jerusalem Cross, along with the term "Deus vult" (God wills it) that was associated with the Crusaders, were deployed by the far-right during a violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.

As yet, however, the Jerusalem Cross has not been listed as a hate symbol by the influential Anti-Defamation League.

Last week, the US president's son, Donald Trump Jr, defended posting a photo of himself holding a rifle (known as a "Crusader") that featured a Jerusalem Cross - as well as an image of Hillary Clinton in jail.

The photo - posted days after the US assassinated Iranian general Qasem Soleimani - was consistent with a tradition among gun owners of "depicting various historical warriors", Mr Trump Jr's spokesman told the Washington Post. The company that produced the rifle said it was "objectively silly" to suggest the cross was a hate symbol.

"As with all symbols, context is everything," said Dan Jones, a historian and author of Crusaders: The Epic History of the Wars for the Holy Lands.

Jones himself has a tattoo of the Jerusalem Cross on his wrist. He received it a few years ago in Jerusalem, copying a technique used by pilgrims hundreds of years ago.

"In the context of a Christian pilgrimage to Jerusalem, this would have been a symbol of peaceful worship," Jones said.

"But in the context of Donald Trump Jr with a Jerusalem Cross on the side of an AR-15 rifle, the context is very clearly one of violence - anti-Muslim violence - and of a civilisational clash going back to the Middle Ages."

The fact the cross has different meanings, like the swastika before it, means any presidential candidate should be more cautious about using it, Jones said, as appropriation of such symbols could play into the hands of those who consider the US to be aggressors.

"[Tom Steyer] clearly has his own reasons for scribbling it on his hand," Jones said. "But he has to be aware of the other context. Were he to be elected president, then Isis propaganda would be calling him the Crusader-in-chief."

Such a development is unlikely, however. As the Democrats enter primary season, the polls put Mr Steyer far down the list of favourites for the Democratic nomination.

A driver who killed a mother-of-two in a crash was seen months later drinking wine behind the wheel.

Adam White, 38, ploughed into the back of another car before hitting Katy Cunningham's vehicle on the A16 in Cambridgeshire in January 2019.

Her 11-year-old daughter, who was also in the car, "almost died", Peterborough Crown Court heard.

White, of Spalding, Lincolnshire, was jailed for nine years after admitting causing her death by dangerous driving.

The court heard White was seen driving aggressively for about three miles before the crash between Peterborough and Spalding on 23 January.

Other drivers had commented he was "driving like a lunatic" while weaving in and out of traffic, the court was told.

Prosecutor Marti Blair said Mrs Cunningham and her two children were coming in the other direction and her car "ended up on its side in an adjoining field".

Mrs Cunningham, from Peterborough, was later pronounced dead and her daughter, Freya, was in a coma for nearly two weeks.

The court was told White was twice over the drink drive limit and also badly hurt in the crash.

When interviewed in May he said "he had tried to do dry January" but "had fancied a pint".

About a month later in June, he was caught three times over the drink drive limit at a car wash, having been "seen drinking from a bottle of wine", Ms Blair said.

White was charged in December 2019 over the crash involving Mrs Cunningham.

Ms Blair said he had four previous convictions related to drink driving prior to the crash on the A16.

In a victim impact statement, Mrs Cunningham's husband Chris said White "nearly wiped out my entire family".

Mitigating, Will Martin, said White had asked for him to say "he is sorry".

Judge Matthew Lowe told White: "Two children have not only received life-threatening injuries but have also lost their mother.

"Her life was precious. Her life was priceless. These collisions were a culmination of a sustained course of aggressive high-speed driving by this defendant."

White also admitted three counts of causing serious injury while driving and was banned from driving for 10 years, with an extension period of four and a half years.</text><tags>Crowland, Peterborough, Spalding</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-51042236<category>uk</category><title>More men needed to donate blood 'high in iron'</title><text>Video

Iran is facing fresh pressure to give a full accounting of how the Ukrainian plane with 176 people on board was shot down over Tehran last week.

In London, ministers from five nations which lost citizens demanded "full co-operation" from Iran in a transparent international inquiry into the crash.

The foreign ministers of Afghanistan, Britain, Canada, Sweden and Ukraine also said Iran must pay compensation.

Iran has said the plane was brought down by a missile fired in error.

The Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800, travelling to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and carrying many passengers on their way to Canada, was downed amid escalating tensions between Iran and the US. There were no survivors.

Hours before, Iranian missiles had targeted two airbases in Iraq housing US forces.

For three days after the tragedy Iran denied any responsibility but after international pressure, the hardline Revolutionary Guards admitted that the plane had been mistaken for a "cruise missile" and shot down.

The crisis has come at an extremely sensitive time for Iran, both in terms of its relationship with the international community and at home, where there have been anti-government protests.

What's the meeting in London about?

At a news briefing, the five foreign ministers said they had agreed on five key demands to Iran, including a "thorough, independent and transparent international investigation" and compensation to the victims' families.

Speaking on behalf the group, Canadian Foreign Minister Fran&#231;ois-Philippe Champagne said: "We are here to pursue closure, accountability, transparency and justice for the victims - Ukrainian, Swedish, Afghan, British, Canadian as well as Iranian, through a full complete and transparent international investigation.

"In the wake of such a horrific tragedy there are many many questions. Families want answers, all of the countries assembled here today want answers, and the international community want answers. The world is waiting for those answers and we will not rest until we get them."

Mr Champagne said all those responsible must be brought to justice.

Earlier on Thursday, the five ministers lit memorial candles at the Canadian High Commission in London to honour the victims.

Canada is investigating reports that the families of some victims have been harassed by authorities in Iran and urged to keep quiet.

Many of the foreign nationals killed are believed to have held dual nationality and Canada's government says it is "deeply concerned" about alleged pressure on Iranian-Canadian families not to repatriate remains.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC on Tuesday that he was "glad" Iran had acknowledged making a "terrible mistake" in shooting down the plane.

"It's good that they've apologised. The most important thing now is that tensions in the region calm down," he added.

Can Iran be held accountable?

Afghanistan, Britain, Canada, Sweden and Ukraine are considering what legal options they might have to hold Iran accountable.

Mr Johnson has said the families of the British victims "deserve justice and closure and we will continue to do everything we can to support them in getting that, including options for compensation".

Iran is creating a special court to oversee the investigation, but victims' families may want to pursue legal judgments elsewhere.

Dozens of the victims are Canadian nationals and there have been calls in Canada for the government to list the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist entity, paving the way for lawsuits under a 2012 law allowing victims of terrorism to sue state sponsors of terrorism in civil courts.

However, this would involve proving that the plane's downing was an intentional act of terrorism. Even if a case succeeded, claiming any damages awarded would be difficult given most of Iran's non-diplomatic assets in Canada have already been seized to collect damages in other cases.

What's going on in Iran?

On Wednesday, Canadian investigators in Iran visited the site of the crash and examined the plane's wreckage.

They are expecting to be able to participate in the analysis of the plane's black box flight recorders - a key part of figuring out exactly what happened to the plane and how it crashed.

Iran arrested several people over the incident and President Hassan Rouhani said the investigation would be overseen by a "special court", noting that "the whole world will be watching".

The Revolutionary Guards has said a missile operator acted independently and alone, mistaking the plane for a "cruise missile" as there had been reports that such missiles had been fired at Iran after its strikes in Iraq.

But Mr Rouhani has stressed that the "tragic event" should not be blamed on one individual.

On Wednesday, in a sign of friction between the government and the armed forces over the incident, he called on Iran's military to elaborate on how it shot down the plane. His foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, acknowledged that Iranians had been "lied to" for days but insisted the government was also kept in the dark.

The Revolutionary Guards, a force set up to defend the government after the 1979 revolution, has claimed government officials were alerted soon after the incident.

The shooting down of the plane and its fall-out led to days of protests in some Iranian cities, with demonstrators condemning the authorities for not telling the truth.

Iran is facing pressures on many fronts - its economy is struggling under US sanctions, its most powerful general was recently killed by a US drone strike, and a nuclear deal it signed with world powers looks close to collapse.</text><tags>Ukraine Iran plane crash, Hassan Rouhani, Canada, Iran, Ukraine Iran plane crash</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51140930<category>world</category><title>Trump impeachment: Senators sworn in for historic trial</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption &#8216;Hear ye, hear ye!&#8217; Trump impeachment trial begins

The 100 lawmakers of the US Senate were sworn in on Thursday as jurors for the impending impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.

Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Roberts administered the oath to the senators to "do impartial justice".

In the coming weeks, the senators will decide whether Mr Trump should be removed from office over charges brought by the House of Representatives.

The trial is scheduled to begin on 21 January.

Justice Roberts asked the senators, "Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, President of the United States, now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and the laws, so help you God?"

The lawmakers responded with "I do" before each signing in a book that they took the oath. Republican senate leader Mitch McConnell then adjourned the pre-trial proceedings and announced the trial would begin at 13:00 EST (18:00 GMT) on Tuesday.

Mr Trump is accused of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He has denied wrongdoing and branded the case against him as a "hoax".

What happened on Thursday?

The Senate proceedings began with the sergeant at arms calling "hear ye, hear ye". The articles of impeachment were then read out on the floor of the chamber by Democratic congressman and lead prosecutor Adam Schiff.

Mr Schiff is one of seven impeachment managers who will make the case against the president. He said no president had ever sought to impede an impeachment investigation so thoroughly.

Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the senate, again called for new witnesses and documents to be permitted in the trial. "The gravity of these charges is self-evident. The House of Representatives have accused the president of trying to shake down a foreign leader for personal gain," Mr Schumer said.

Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who is facing a tough re-election bid this year, was seen wiping away tears from her face as the charges were read.

In the lead-up to the trial, senior Democrats heavily criticised Mr McConnell after he pledged to work in "total co-ordination" with the president - seemingly abrogating the sworn duty of Republican senators to act as impartial jurors.

Speaking after Thursday's proceedings, Mr Schumer told reporters: "McConnell said he's going to take his cues from the president. We are taking our cues from nobody."

Mr Schumer said he expects a vote next week on whether witnesses will be called. He said he had not seen the resolution put together by the Republican leader regarding the rules of the trial.

Mr McConnell has not ruled out witnesses. He suggested the format would mimic the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, during which senators voted on which witnesses to call following opening arguments and a written question period.

As things wrapped up on Capitol Hill on Thursday, Mr Trump told reporters in the White House he thought the trial "should go very quickly".

"It's a complete hoax," the president said. "A phony hoax put through by the Democrats so they can win an election." He reiterated the sentiment in a tweet, saying he was impeached "for making a perfect phone call".

What's the background?

Democrats allege the president withheld $391m (&#163;299m) in military aid in order to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Mr Trump is the third US president to be impeached. The previous two - Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton - were not removed from office.

A two-thirds majority in the Senate is required to oust a president. As Mr Trump's Republicans control the senate, he is widely expected to be acquitted. His defence team has not been formally announced, but White House lawyers Pat Cipollone and Jay Sekulow have been tipped to lead it.

The House voted on Wednesday to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, with the 228-193 vote split mostly along party lines.

The trial is likely to still be under way next month when Iowa and New Hampshire hold the first party votes to pick the eventual Democratic presidential candidate who will take on President Trump in November's election. Three of the candidates - Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar - are US senators and will have to drastically scale down campaigning to attend the trial.

Two other leading contenders, Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, plan to capitalise on their rivals' diversion by blitzing Iowa in the last few days before the crucial 3 February vote in that state.

Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has expressed regret over his handling of the bushfire crisis ravaging the country.

The PM has faced mounting criticism over his government's response to the bushfires and its climate policy.

Since September, bushfires have killed at least 28 people and destroyed thousands of homes.

On Sunday, Mr Morrison conceded there were "things I could have handled on the ground much better".

In recent weeks, Mr Morrison has been heckled by locals when visiting fire-hit communities in the states of New South Wales and Victoria, where the worst blazes are concentrated.

In the town of Cobargo in New South Wales, one woman demanded more resources for the fire service, while others called Mr Morrison an "idiot" and said "you won't be getting any votes down here".

"These are sensitive environments, they are very emotional environments," Mr Morrison said in a TV interview with ABC.

"Prime ministers are flesh and blood too in how they engage with these people."

Acknowledging the pressure fire services were facing, Mr Morrison said there was a "new appetite" for the government to take a more direct role in responding to the disaster.

The PM said he would seek a royal commission review - a type of public inquiry - into the country's response to the bushfire crisis.

Last month, Mr Morrison was criticised for going on holiday to Hawaii as the bushfire crisis worsened. The rising public anger at his absence eventually forced him to cut that trip short.

What did the PM say about climate change?

Mr Morrison's government has been accused of not doing enough to address climate change, which experts say could increase the intensity, frequency and scale of bushfires.

But in the interview, the PM defended his government's approach, which he said took into account the effect of climate change on the bushfires.

"We're living in longer, hotter, drier summers," the PM said. "This is obviously affected by the broader changes in climate."

Pressed on his plan to reduce carbon emissions, Mr Morrison insisted his government was on track to "meet and beat" its targets.

Under the Paris climate agreement, Australia has pledged to cut emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.

However, Mr Morrison said a "global solution" was needed to tackle climate change.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Morrison's government has faced scrutiny over its policies on climate change

Tens of thousands of people across Australia took part in climate change protests on Friday.

In cities including Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, demonstrators turned out to press Mr Morrison's government to make a quick transition away from fossil fuels.

What is the current situation with the fires?

Bushfire conditions eased on Saturday, giving firefighters temporary respite in areas where blazes are still raging.

But with more hot weather expected next week, the risk was far from over, authorities warned.

Authorities have warned that the huge fires, spurred by high temperatures, wind and a three-year-drought, will persist until there is substantial rainfall.

More than 123 fires are still burning across New South Wales, with 50 said to be uncontained.

According to NSW Rural Fire Service, more than 2,000 homes have been destroyed so far during this fire season.

In Victoria, there were 32 bushfire warnings in place as of Saturday.

"Have a pleasant journey," blurts the tannoy, as the engines ramp up and we pull away from the harbour in Fynshav, southern Denmark.

I'm aboard Ellen, an electric-powered ferry, sailing to the island of &#198;r&#248;, in the west Baltic Sea.

On the ship's bridge, Captain Thomas Larsen stands behind a panel with controls and electronic charts. "What I can see on these two screens is a power management system," he points out. "It shows me all my batteries. And how far I can expect to go."

"The main difference is that I don't have a full fuel tank. I need to think a lot about how I'm using my power."

As we talk an alarm starts beeping. "Oh this tells me I do not have power for a new return trip without recharging," Captain Larsen says calmly.

Powered entirely by batteries, Ellen is something of a Tesla among ferries. Fully charged, the 60m vessel can sail 22 nautical miles with up to 200 passengers and 30 cars onboard.

Image copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Ellen has a range of 22 nautical miles

That's a roughly 40km (25-mile) round-trip, and seven times further than other electric ferries.

Ellen replaces an older diesel-powered vessel, and in the onboard cafe passengers welcome the change.

"It doesn't make so much noise. And no smoke from the diesel - it's good," one traveller tells me.

"It's very quiet. You don't feel anything. It's a great idea also for the environment," says another.

"Ferry shipping in general is very dirty business," says Halfdan Abrahamsen, an information officer from &#198;r&#248; EnergyLab, as he shows me around.

More Technology of Business

Ships usually use marine diesel or heavy fuel oil, "which is just about the bottom of the food chain when it comes to product from refineries," says Mr Abrahamsen.

The only oil onboard Ellen is for the gearbox and in the kitchen for making French fries, he says.

The emission-free ferry is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by 2,000 tonnes a year. It's part of an EU-backed project to develop green ferries for longer routes.

Beyond a set of heavy metal doors, lies the engine and two battery rooms, where 840 lithium-ion batteries supplied by Swiss firm Leclanch&#233;, are stacked from floor to ceiling.

Image copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Two battery rooms house 840 lithium-ion batteries

Totalling 4.3MWh, it has the biggest battery capacity of any ship at sea and equivalent to the average amount of electricity a UK household consumes each year.

And that means it can sail further than any other electric ferry operating at the moment, according to Kimmo Rauma, vice-president of Danfoss Editron, the Finland-based company behind the electrical propulsion and charging technology.

After a 70 minute voyage, Ellen arrives at the harbour in S&#248;by and moors alongside the charging station.

A mechanical arm plugs in and recharges the batteries in less than 25 minutes with clean energy supplied by local wind turbines.

Ellen is not fully operational just yet, and it hasn't all been smooth sailing. Building a boat with so many batteries is complex and since being launched some battery cells have been replaced.

Image copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Trine Heinemann says Ellen's running costs are a quarter that of a diesel ferry

"They're getting lighter and more energy dense, but they're still heavy," Trine Heinemann, the E-Ferry project coordinator explains, as we stand on the dockside.

"The more energy you need, the more batteries you need, the more weight you add. You then have to start thinking about how do we take other weight away from the ship? How do you build the most energy-efficient ship?"

A lower resistance design and more lightweight materials were used, contributing to Ellen's low running costs.

"We are paying maybe 25% of what you would pay for running a similar diesel vessel." says Ms Heinemann. "So that's the significant saving."

Maintenance costs are much lower too. A diesel engine has about 30,000 moving parts, in an electric motor it's just the bearings that need maintenance, Dr Rauma says.

Image copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption The green box on the right recharges Ellen's batteries

The ferry has cost &#8364;21.3m (US$23.6m; &#163;18.3m), with the EU's Horizon 2020 programme funding &#8364;15m.

"It's maybe 40% more expensive than a conventional diesel vessel," Ms Heinemann says.

"Then you still have the transformer and the electrical infrastructure. So in terms of establishing an electrical vessel, we are looking at a significantly higher cost."

So while battery power is certainly greener, is it commercially viable? The team believes so.

"Some say within 14 months you break even and then it's saving from then on. We're being a little bit more conservative and saying maybe four or five years," says Ms Heinemann.

At S&#248;by Shipyard, where Ellen was built, chief executive Roar Falkenberg thinks costs will come down.

"Ellen was a prototype. I think when we build the next Ellen, it will be only cost a bit more than a normal ferry. And if you look three to five years ahead, I think the price will be the same."

Batteries are getting more cost-competitive says Dr Tristan Smith, a shipping and energy expert from University College London, thanks largely to better technology and stricter emissions rules.

"If you have strong air quality regulation then you aren't able to burn the worst quality marine fuels," he says, "which then makes the battery more competitive, because it's now competing against the more expensive fossil fuel."

The shipping industry is responsible for around 3% of global CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions. In April 2018, the International Maritime Organisation set new targets to reduce these emissions by "at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008" levels.

That's spurring industry players to explore new emission-cutting measures including alternatives fuels like LNG, biofuel, also hydrogen and ammonia which Dr Smith thinks show most promise.

Image copyright Norled Image caption Norled is part of a hydrogen-powered ferry project

Nordic countries have led a shift towards hybrid and electric power. The first fully-electric car ferry was launched in Norway a few years ago, and the operator Norled is now developing, what it claims will be the world's first hydrogen-fuelled ferry.

"The technology is ready," says Danfoss Editron's Kimmo Rauma. "The question is that the maritime industry is not the fastest to change."

His firm has supplied electric technology for patrol-boats, icebreakers, and fish farming service boats.

It also developed Asia's first e-ferry in Taiwan. He says retrofitting older diesel vessels with electric engines, particularly in city harbour areas, is a "big opportunity" to reduce pollution.

However experts say that scaling up battery power for large ships has significant limitations.

"The common denominator for successful battery use is that the vessels operate close to shore," says Maria Skipper Schwenn, a director at industry body, Danish Shipping.

"The operational reach is limited simply due to the capacity of the battery itself. It's simply not possible today when you are sailing more than 10 or 20 days at sea. In addition to that you need an enormous charging capacity in the port."

"With the technology we have right now&#8230; it doesn't seem like a viable solution for the deep-sea shipping. But for ferries, supply ships and tugboats, it's an excellent solution."

Back at S&#248;by Shipyard, Roar Falkenberg agrees. "The key is how much energy can you store in the battery. If you have to sail from England to the United States, you need a lot! And then you can't have any cargo, you can only have batteries. Maybe in 10 years, 15 years, there will be other ways for longer ship routes."</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-51129653<category>uk</category><title>Scottish FA expected to ban children heading footballs within weeks</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Scottish FA expected to ban children heading footballs

A ban on children heading the ball in Scotland could be in place in a matter of weeks due to fears over the links between football and dementia.

BBC Scotland has learned the Scottish FA wants to lead the way on the issue after a report found former players are more at risk of dying from the disease.

The governing body is expected to announce a ban on under-12s heading the ball in training later this month.

A similar ban has been in place in the US since 2015.

But Scotland would become the first European country to impose a restriction on head contact.

Discussions have been ongoing since the release of a study in October which found the first links between former players and degenerative brain disease.

The Scottish FA's doctor, John MacLean, was part of the team which highlighted that former players are three-and-a-half times more likely to die of dementia.

There remains no firm evidence linking heading the ball to the disease but Dr MacLean thinks a restriction of head contact is common sense.

He said: "We can't wait on the evidence one way or the other on heading.

"We need to take some sensible, pragmatic steps at the moment and that's largely going to be about trying to reduce that overall burden, the overall times that young players head - and heading in training is much more common than in matches.

"The study was never designed to, and couldn't identify, why. But I think most people would say, pragmatically, that it would be head injury or heading, in whatever combination that would be."

Gordon Smith, former chief executive of the Scottish FA, welcomed the proposed ban and told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that young players could still be taught heading techniques safely if they used lighter balls.

"We should be using plastic balls so that the young players could get the technique without having to head the ball," he said. "They'll be told that heading is part of the game as they come through, but they don't have to be heading the big balls immediately.

"They're better [off] using a softball so they actually develop the technique, but there's no effect on them for later days."

'We have a responsibility to our players'

Glasgow's largest youth football club has welcomed the Scottish FA proposals three months after its own policy change.

Giffnock Soccer Centre has banned heading across its smaller-sided squads up to and including the 7-a-side teams.

Club chairman Craig Inglis said: "As a community club we're parents first and coaches second. In light of the available medical evidence we felt a responsibility to safeguard the future health of our youngest players.

"Although some of the ongoing scientific studies are yet to report, there is a growing consensus among the medical community that heading the football contributes towards players developing dementia and other brain conditions later in life.

"We have a responsibility to our players and would rather give families clear direction on this issue. Our football development work focuses on building skills with the feet 'on the deck' and this is what we will be focusing on."

The Scottish FA move to ban under-12s heading balls will pose questions for national associations across the world when the plans become a reality.

The Football Association in England told the BBC their position remains unchanged - that there is "no evidence to suggest that heading should be banned in youth football" and that it is "significantly less common in children's games than people often think".

The Scottish FA's move will also be a relief for Dr Willie Stewart, who led the study that found the link in the first place.

He said: "I'm delighted. I think that while there were many questions left unanswered by our report, I think the one thing that came through is that football needs to change in some way.

"We can't go on looking at a risk of three-and-a-half times higher neurogenerative disease in footballers and not do something about it, so this is great."

'Leading the rest of football'

It is also being seen as a progressive move by those who have played the game.

Former Wales, Arsenal and Celtic striker John Hartson says the Scottish FA should be applauded for leading the way on something that seems obvious.

He said "Heading was a massive part of my game. Managers bought me because I could head the ball.

"There have been some serious situations where players have lost their lives and ex-legends suffering from dementia, so I'm glad the SFA are leading the rest of football and doing something about it."

The ban is likely to be confirmed by the Scottish FA in the coming weeks when all stakeholders have signed up to the plan.</text><tags>Dementia</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51057261<category>technology</category><title>CES 2020: Samsung's invisible keyboard for smartphones</title><text>Video

They want to transform some of the CO2 that&#8217;s overheating the planet into products to benefit humanity.

They don&#8217;t claim the technology will solve climate change, but they say it will help.

Carbon dioxide is already being used in novel ways to create fuels, polymers, fertilisers, proteins, foams and building blocks.

Until recently, it was assumed that energy-intensive firms burning gas to fuel their processes would need eventually to capture the resulting carbon emissions and bury them underground.

This option is inefficient and costly, so the prospect of utilising some of the CO2 as a valuable raw material is exciting for business.

Katy Armstrong, manager of the Carbon Utilisation Centre at Sheffield University, put it this way: &#8220;We need products for the way we live - and everything we do has an impact.

&#8220;We need to manufacture our products without increasing CO2 emissions, and if we can use waste CO2 to help make them, so much the better.&#8221;

Many of the young carbon usage firms are actually carbon-negative: that means they take in more CO2 than they put out.

We visited three pioneering businesses in the UK which are already making money out of CO2.

Here are their recipes for success (or at least, the ones they will share with us).

Three success stories

CO2 to fertiliser: CCm Technologies, Swindon

Image caption Fertiliser plants like this one using CO2 in Swindon can help solve the problem

Recipe: Put cow dung and maize into a bio-digester, where bacteria break them down and produce biogas to heat our homes.

Mix the left-over sludge with nutrient-rich wastes from the fertiliser industry, sewage plants, farms or the food industry.

Pump in CO2, which helps the nutrients bind to the sludge.

Product: High-grade fertiliser pellets that have soaked up more CO2 than they produced. The technology has already won export orders.

CO2 to beer bubbles: Strutt and Parker Farms, Suffolk

Image caption Can this beauty put the fizz in your lemonade?

Recipe: Take horse muck and straw from Newmarket races. Put the smelly mess through a bio-digester (as above).

Extract biogas and CO2. Using advanced membranes, separate out food grade CO2.

Product: Clean CO2 that&#8217;s sold to a local brewery to put the fizz into lemonade and lager.

CO2 to building blocks: Carbon 8 Aggregates, Leeds

Image caption Bio-digester processing horse manure in Suffolk

Recipe: Take ash from the chimney of a waste incinerator plant.

Mix in water and CO2 - then stand back&#8230; this procedure gets very hot.

The CO2 is permanently captured within the waste ash to form artificial limestone for building blocks and other purposes.

The process has the additional benefit of treating the ash that would otherwise be sent to landfill.

Product: blocks that have locked up CO2, whilst also reducing the need for carbon-intensive cement. The technology is winning exports.

These firms are pioneers in what&#8217;s known as the Circular Economy, in which wastes are turned into raw materials. The EU is trying to prompt all industry to adopt this principle.

How much CO2 can products absorb?

The big question is how much of the approximately 37 gigatonnes of CO2 emitted annually from our homes, cars, planes, offices and industries can be utilised by industry.

One report projected that seven gigatonnes a year of CO2 could be locked up into new products.

Katy Armstrong described this figure as hugely optimistic. But she said: &#8220;Every tonne that&#8217;s captured is a tonne that doesn't heat the atmosphere, so let&#8217;s hope the industry thrives.&#8221;

An "inspirational" seven-year-old boy from Essex who died from cancer has been given a last farewell by the people in his home town.

Laughlin Whiteley, of Burnham-on-Crouch, who recently received an award from Prince Harry, died two weeks ago.

Friends and family lined the town's High Street as a horse-drawn cortege carried Laughlin's body to a private funeral service.

His three-year illness was charted in an online blog by his father.

Lockey, as he was known, was found to have a brain tumour aged four.

In February, he had a stem cell transplant for a rare leukaemia and was given the all-clear, but suffered a relapse of the blood cancer.

Michelle Richardson, from the Unlock a Life for Lockey campaign, said: "Today is about celebrating Laughlin's life and bringing happiness not only to the family, but to the whole community who are here... to just smile and get his family through today.

"He was a very special boy, he always managed to smile, he was very courageous and inspirational to everybody he knew.

"It's a day to remember him, remember what he went through and to bring strength to everybody."

Last month, national charity for sick children WellChild named Laughlin as its Most Inspirational Child of the Year after receiving hundreds of nominations for the title.

Its patron, Prince Harry, gave Lockey his award at a London hotel.

Laughlin's parents set up a charity earlier this year to distribute craft boxes to children at Great Ormond Street Hospital, where he was being treated.

The charity also plans to hold a ball in 2015 to help raise funds to support other children with cancer.

"The ambition is to create a holiday home on the Norfolk/Suffolk border to give give families of children going through treatment a bit of respite and to have some quality time with the family," said Ms Richardson.</text><tags>Cancer, Burnham on Crouch</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51131418<category>world</category><title>Indians bake the world's 'longest cake'</title><text>Video

Around 1,500 chefs in the southern Indian state of Kerala came together to bake a vanilla cake - and as you can imagine, it was no ordinary confectionery treat.

The cake, which was made with 12,000kg (26,455 lbs) of sugar and flour, stretched for more than six kilometres (3.7 miles), and is believed to be the world's longest.

The chefs were trying to break the world record for the longest cake. That honour is currently held by Chinese chefs who baked a cake about half as long in 2018.

NHS services across England and Scotland have been hit by a large-scale cyber-attack that has disrupted hospital and GP appointments.

The prime minister said the incident was part of an untargeted wider attack affecting organisations globally.

Some hospitals and GPs have been unable to access patient data, after their computers were locked by a ransomware program demanding a payment worth &#163;230.

But there is no evidence patient data has been compromised, NHS Digital said.

The BBC understands about 40 NHS organisations and some GP practices have been hit. The NHS in Wales and Northern Ireland has not been affected.

There is no indication of who is behind the attack yet, but the hackers demanded their payment in the virtual currency Bitcoin, which is harder to trace.

Prime Minister Theresa May said: "This is not targeted at the NHS, it's an international attack and a number of countries and organisations have been affected."

Ambulances diverted

Mrs May added that the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was "working closely" with the NHS "to ensure that they support the organisations concerned and that they protect patient safety".

Ambulances have been diverted from hospitals in some areas and there has been disruption at some GP surgeries as a result of the attack.

NHS England said patients in an emergency should go to A&amp;E or access emergency services as they normally would.

Dr Anne Rainsberry, NHS incident director, added: "More widely, we ask people to use the NHS wisely while we deal with this major incident, which is still ongoing."

A massive ransomware campaign appears to have attacked a number of organisations around the world, with reports of infections in more than 70 countries.

Telefonica, the Spanish telecoms company which owns mobile network O2, said it had detected a "cybersecurity incident" but that clients and services had not been affected.

Screenshots of a program that locks computers and demands a payment in Bitcoin have been shared online by those affected.

NHS Digital said the attack was believed to have been carried out by the malware variant Wanna Decryptor.

"Our focus is on supporting organisations to manage the incident swiftly and decisively, but we will continue to communicate with NHS colleagues and will share more information as it becomes available," it said.

Why has the NHS been hit so hard?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware?

There could be a lot of reasons why the NHS was hit so hard by this attack.

The most likely one is because it is a huge organisation supported by a massive IT infrastructure.

It also has lots of partners and suppliers that connect to its core network.

Complexity is the enemy of security and it is a fair bet that some bits of that network, especially those operated by suppliers, are not as well maintained as they should be.

This could mean that patches that would have thwarted WannaCry were not applied.

So, as soon as the worm got in, it could run rampant.

Dr Chris Mimnagh, who works at a medical centre in Liverpool, said the attack had made its job impossible.

"Our entire patient record is accessed through the computer - blood results, history, medicines.

"Most of our prescribing is done electronically... it's sent direct to the pharmacy and... all that is not able to be accessed when we lose the clinical system."

'Power of the state'

Dr Emma Fardon, a GP in Dundee, said she had returned from house visits to find a message on the surgery's computers asking for money.

"We can't access any patient records. Everything is fully computerised," she said.

"We have no idea what drugs people are on or the allergies they have. We can't access the appointments system."

Dr Afzal Ashraf, an expert on cyber-security who has previously worked as an adviser to the government, told the BBC it was likely that the malware was spreading when NHS services shared documents and information.

But he also said he thought it was unlikely the attackers had deliberately targeted the NHS.

He added: "I think they probably attacked a small company assuming they would get a small amount of money but it's got into the NHS system and now they have the full power of the state against them - because obviously the government cannot afford for this sort of thing to happen and be successful."

Women who have recently had a miscarriage are at risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder, doctors at Imperial College London have said.

At their early pregnancy loss clinic, a third of the women have PTSD symptoms.

Nicole Martin had three miscarriages in a year, her "dark days".

"Everyone thinks because you've already got a child it's easier. In a lot of respects it definitely is easier than not having a child, but I wanted another child for [my child's] sake."

Nicole and her husband, Ben, started trying for their second child just after their first, Eva, had turned one.

"I was 38 years old and fully aware of the risks associated with having children a bit later in life," she says.

"It took me longer than expected to fall pregnant, and when I did I felt very anxious because many of my friends had suffered at least one miscarriage."

Nicole's story

She was carrying twins, but both died - one at five weeks and the other seven weeks into the pregnancy.

Nicole had to have an operation under general anaesthetic to treat the miscarriage.

Although shell-shocked by the experience, Ben and Nicole continued to try for a baby.

Two months later, Nicole was pregnant, but had another miscarriage at seven weeks.

"The scan showed there was no heartbeat," she says.

"We had to have medical management this time.

"You get given a tablet which breaks down the lining of your womb and you just get sent home to miscarry.

"It's really not pleasant.

"It's your baby, and you have to flush it down the loo.

"It's horrendous."

Pregnancy loss and PTSD

Post-traumatic stress disorder can develop after a very stressful, frightening or distressing event, or a prolonged traumatic experience.

As many as one in four pregnancies is thought to end in a miscarriage - loss of a pregnancy during the first 23 weeks.

An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, usually in one of the fallopian tubes.

It is not possible to save the pregnancy. It usually has to be removed using medicine or an operation.

Her subsequent third miscarriage a few months later left her a nervous wreck.

"I was a mess," she says.

"Everywhere I went mothers were asking me, 'When are you going to have another child?'

"I never ask a woman now about whether she's having babies, or having a second baby, because you never know their story."

Nicole says she nearly gave up all hope.

"I found it just unbelievably cruel," she says.

"I remember phoning my consultant who was great.

"I said, 'Just tell me what I should do.'

"I really wanted someone from the medical profession to say, 'Just give up.'"

Instead, the consultant told Nicole to keep trying if she had the emotional strength because there was still a good chance she would be able to have a healthy baby.

Two months later - just after Nicole's 40th birthday - she was pregnant with her son, Joseph, who is now nearly two years old.

"I still worry a lot, and I'm having cognitive behavioural therapy to help me cope with that," she says.

"Even though we have two beautiful children, I still feel anxious to this day because I can't quite believe it's all over.

"I feel that something's going to spoil our lovely family unit because it was such a struggle getting there."

Dr Jessica Farren, who carried out the BMJ Open study on nearly 90 women attending the pregnancy clinic at Imperial College London for a suspected miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, says although only a minority might have full-blown PTSD, many will suffer from moderate-to-severe anxiety.

"It's the tip of the iceberg really," he says.

"There will be a huge number of women who would still benefit from some support. But the NHS isn't geared up for it.

"Once we've looked after these women clinically and discharged them, there's no real opportunity to check how they are coping emotionally."

After a healthy pregnancy, all women get screened for depression at their six-week check. But following a miscarriage, there are no routine emotional checks.

Dr Farren and her colleagues are studying more women at their clinic to see if they can better spot those that will need the most support.

In the meantime, they say help is out there if you know where to look.

"There are some really good charities and organisations that can offer counselling, and your GP is a good place to start if you want some help accessing support," says Dr Farren.</text><tags>Miscarriage, Pregnancy</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51048617<category>business</category><title>The billionaire retailer whose shops had no stock</title><text>Image copyright H Takai Image caption Luiza Trajano has led the family company since 1991

The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Brazilian retail billionaire Luiza Trajano.

With inflation hitting a whopping 3,000%, and new currencies being introduced and then quickly ditched, it was not easy to be a retailer in the Brazil of the early 1990s.

That was the tough economic backdrop faced by Luiza Trajano, then 40, when she took up the top job at her family's chain of shops selling home electronics and household appliances in 1991.

The business, called Magazine Luiza, had a small chain in the southern state of Sao Paulo. But Luiza had ambitious plans to expand nationwide. And she had a cunning plan.

With inflation that high, and the Brazilian government introducing and then abandoning no fewer than four different currencies between 1989 and 1994, it would have been risky to start opening more large stores stocking the entire range of products.

Image copyright Luana Ferreira Image caption The business now has more than 1,000 shops across Brazil

So Luiza decided to open a chain of micro shops that didn't stock anything. Starting in 1992, customers would instead sit down at a computer terminal, and browse a computerised catalogue of all the items on sale. They would then order what they wanted, and Magazine Luiza would deliver it to their homes from a network of nationwide distribution depots.

It was a precursor to online sales, from a time before Brazil got the internet - access to the net only became available to consumers in Brazil in 1997.

In addition to enabling Magazine Luiza to quickly and cheaply expand, the small "electronic shops" also meant that the company didn't have to keep printing out new physical price labels in response to inflation or a new currency. It just had to update the prices on its computer system.

Looking back, Luiza, who is now 68, says: "It was a big revolution, we introduced a new way of virtual sales. It prepared us for the internet before anyone else."

She says that she also made sure that the company put a lot of effort into explaining the expansion plans to staff, to ensure that they were happy and motivated, and therefore offering good customer service.

"We did intense work with our team, explaining our targets and how we need everyone. We were very transparent with how they played an important role in this new movement."

Image copyright Luiza Trajano Image caption Luiza says that she loved being a saleswoman

Within three years Magazine Luiza had a few hundred of its shops across Brazil, with some large cities having as many as 58 outlets. Today the company has more than 1,000 stores across Brazil and 30,000 employees. Meanwhile, its website accounts for 48% of sales and it has total annual revenues of 19.7bn real ($4.9bn; &#163;3.7bn).

The success of the business has made Luiza one of the richest people in Brazil. Her net worth is $3.5bn (&#163;2.7bn), according to Forbes magazine.

The first Magazine Luiza shop was opened in 1957 by Luiza's aunt and uncle, in her home city of Franca, 400km (250 miles) north of the city of Sao Paulo, The word "magazine" was chosen as a variation of the French word for shop, "magasin", while "Luiza" was also her aunt's first name.

Luiza started helping her aunt and uncle at the shop from the age of 12, working in the afternoon and early evening after she had finished school. "I was a saleswoman, and it was still a very small shop [at the time]," she says. "I loved the experience, and it was a success."

When Luiza went to university to study law, she still made time to work at the shop. And after graduating she joined the family business full-time.

Over the next two decades she filled a number of increasingly senior roles, before coming chief executive in 1991, as her uncle and aunt stepped back from the day-to-day running of the business.

Another innovation Luiza introduced was opening the stores very early in the morning during sales periods. This might have long been common practice in the UK and North America, but in 1990s Brazil it was a novel development.

"We opened the shops at 5am, something that we had never seen before in Brazil." she says. "Other retail shops started to do the same."

Image copyright Luiza Trajano Image caption She regularly gives talks about entrepreneurship

Today the company is one of the largest retailers in Brazil. With almost half of sales now coming online, the small non-stock shops have been replaced over the years with larger ones that do have some or all products there to take away. The focus on staff happiness remains though, and Magazine Luiza consistently tops the list of the best Brazilian retail companies to work for.

"We have been in first place since 2006," she says. "It is one of my greatest joys after all these years."

While she has no plans to retire, in 2016 Luiza passed the chief executive role over to her son Frederico, while she switched to chairwoman.

More The Boss features:

When not helping to lead the company she gives regular talks on entrepreneurship. Luiza also helps runs an organisation that promotes women in business, health and education. This body, which she created in 2013, is called the Brazilian Women Group and now has more than 4,000 members.

Fernando Blanco, a professor at EOLAS Business School in Sao Paulo, says Luiza is "an icon among entrepreneurs and also an inspiring speaker".

"So it is not hard to imagine her power to motivate the commercial team at Magazine Luiza."

Image copyright Luiza Trajano Image caption Luiza works hard to advance women in business in Brazil

Looking back on Brazil in the 1990s, Luiza says that the country "will always face crises", and that companies just have to make the best of things.

"Many people believe I'm optimistic," she says. "But the truth is that my mind is always focused on the solution. Complaining won't solve the problem, we have to focus on the solution."

She adds that whatever the economic backdrop "there are two things in common in companies that are a success - customer service and innovation".</text><tags>Brazil, Women in business, Retailing, Entrepreneurship, Female entrepreneurs</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51129896<category>uk</category><title>Prince Harry on first royal duty since talks with Queen</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sport should be part of everyone's life - Prince Harry

The Duke of Sussex has met young rugby players at his first public event since he and the Duchess of Sussex said they would step back from royal life.

Prince Harry laughed and joked as he met children in Buckingham Palace's gardens ahead of the Rugby League World Cup 2021 draw, which he hosted.

He also met representatives of the 21 nations playing in the world cup.

Meghan and the couple's son Archie are in Canada but the duke will reportedly stay in the UK for meetings next week.

Talks involving the Queen, Prince Harry, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge to discuss the couple's future were held on Monday at the Queen's Sandringham estate.

The Queen released a statement agreeing to their wish to step back as senior royals, become financially independent and to split their time between the UK and Canada.

On Thursday, the prince appeared relaxed and at ease as he took part in the draw hosted at the palace - despite being questioned about his next move.

BBC Sport journalist Shamoon Hafez, who was at the event, said Prince Harry gave "a loud laugh" when a reporter asked him how talks on his future were going.

Prince Harry hosted the Rugby League World Cup draws for the men's, women's and wheelchair tournaments, as part of his role as patron of the Rugby Football League.

Speaking to BBC News, Jon Dutton, the tournament's chief executive, praised the prince for being "authentic", "engaged" and taking his time to meet representatives from participating nations.

The tournament runs from 23 October to 27 November 2021 in 17 cities across England, with 16 men's, eight women's and eight wheelchair teams taking part.

England will play Samoa in the opening match at St James' Park, Newcastle.

Prince Harry has enjoyed rugby since his school days and was a house games captain at Eton.

The duke was joined by ex-England player Jason Robinson and Dame Katherine Grainger for the draw in the throne room of Buckingham Palace.

"Not only do I continue to see sport actually changing lives, but it's saving lives as well," the prince said at the event.

"Whether it's rugby league or sport in general... it needs to be in everybody's life."

Before the draw, he met two ambassadors for the global tournament - James Simpson, England and Leeds Rhinos wheelchair rugby league star, and Jodie Cunningham, a rugby league player in the Women's Super League for St Helens.

He then spoke to 12 young rugby players from St Vincent de Paul Catholic primary school, who are tag rugby champions in Westminster for the third year running.

Prince Harry joked with the youngsters, telling them to look after the palace grass or he would get in trouble.

Posing for a team picture, he teased them, saying: "Some of you are really warm. Some of you haven't been running around."

Kevin Sinfield, former rugby league England captain and Leeds Rhinos director of rugby, said on Thursday that Prince Harry had been "fantastic for the sport".

"His enthusiasm, his energy, his engagement with young people in particular, has been outstanding," he told BBC Breakfast.

Mr Sinfield said the Royal Family had helped to "massively" improve openness about mental health in rugby league, adding that Prince Harry had "really driven this".

In a video message posted on Instagram on Thursday the prince said he was "proud" to support the tournament's decision to adopt a mental fitness charter - a programme including workshops for 8,000 young players and their families.

"The perception in rugby league is that you need to be tough," he said. "You can't show your feelings, you have to grin and bear it.

"But something like the mental fitness charter will help us make real progress in getting rid of the stigma associated with mental illness, and remind people that it's not just about being physically fit, but more importantly mentally strong."

Mr Sinfield added: "To have a real figurehead involved in it who's championing it left right and centre is only going to do good things."

There has been speculation Prince Harry would travel to Canada after the draw but a source quoted by the Press Association said: "The duke has some meetings here early next week."

Prince Harry's brother, the Duke of Cambridge, did not mention the talks between senior royals during his first official engagement of the year, on a visit to Bradford with the Duchess of Cambridge.

Meghan flew to Canada to join eight-month-old Archie ahead of the meeting.

On Tuesday she visited a charity in Vancouver which campaigns for teenage girls living in poverty.

Justice for Girls said Meghan visited to "discuss climate justice for girls and the rights of indigenous peoples".

Image copyright AFP/Justice for Girls Image caption The Duchess of Sussex discussed "the power of young women's leadership" on a visit in Vancouver, Justice for Girls said

Meghan also visited the Downtown Eastside Women's Centre in Vancouver.

The centre posted a photograph on Facebook of the duchess with staff and visitors, with a caption which said they had talked about "issues affecting women in the community".

Andy Murray says he is not putting a time frame on his recovery from a pelvic injury after delaying his comeback to the middle of February at the earliest.

The injury forced him to miss this month's Australian Open.

He now says "bone bruising" is taking longer to heal than expected.

The Scot, 32, last played at the Davis Cup in November and will now miss tournaments in France and the Netherlands next month.

"I don't want to rush anything or put a timeline on my recovery," said the three-time Grand Slam champion.

"I'm going to listen to my body and step back on the court to compete when the time is right."

He added: "The bone bruising is taking longer to heal that first thought, so I won't be playing in Montpellier or Rotterdam in February."

Murray, who had hip resurfacing surgery at the beginning of 2019, is continuing his rehabilitation and training in the gym, including yoga sessions.

After Wimbledon in 2017, he missed almost a year of tennis because of a career-threatening hip injury.

He then played in only two tournaments between October 2018 and the start of June 2019.

With Feliciano Lopez, Murray won the men's doubles at Queen's Club last June and returned to singles' action in August.

Victory over Stan Wawrinka in the final of an ATP Tour event in Antwerp, Belgium, in October was Murray's first title in two years, before he got injured during the Davis Cup a month later.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-51136284<category>uk</category><title>Dominic Hamlyn: Student died following underwater party trick</title><text>Image copyright Family handout Image caption Dominic Hamlyn became unresponsive while swimming at the family home in Crundale, Kent

A student died during an underwater challenge at his brother's 21st birthday party, an inquest heard.

Dominic Hamlyn, 24, became unresponsive while swimming at the family home in Crundale, Kent, on 28 July.

His father, neurosurgeon Peter Hamlyn, said he had been performing the same "party trick" since he was a child.

Coroner Scott Matthewson said the Cambridge graduate had a pre-existing heart condition and died from "sudden adult death syndrome".

The inquest heard Dominic had challenged a family friend to swim lengths of the pool underwater and had swum about two-and-a-half while holding his breath before he was seen to be not moving.

Unresponsive

Mr Hamlyn told the inquest in Maidstone he gave his son emergency treatment while waiting for the paramedics to arrive.

Dominic was taken to William Harvey Hospital in Ashford but he died about 15 hours later.

His father, who treated boxer Michael Watson after his near-fatal brain injury during his Chris Eubank fight in 1991, said his son had been unresponsive for "seconds rather than minutes" before being pulled out of the pool.

A medical student at the party initially performed CPR before Mr Hamlyn took over until paramedics arrived at about 03:45 GMT.

Image copyright Google Image caption Dominic Hamlyn's father told the inquest he had performed the party trick since the age of 11

Peter Hamlyn said his eldest son could usually swim four or five lengths underwater and would take a series of deep breaths before doing so.

"It was an entirely routine thing which I had seen him do since he was a child," Mr Hamlyn told the court.

He said his son had been an extremely fit athlete, played rugby, cricket and rowed for Downing College, Cambridge. The inquest also heard that alcohol was not relevant

'Lack of awareness'

Pathologist Dr Olaf Biedrzycki said he could have lost consciousness underwater caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain, but "on the balance of probability" it was "an underlying heart condition".

"If he wasn't trying to do more than he had done before, that is slightly more likely than shallow water blackout," he said.

He gave the cause of death as acute cardiac arrhythmia - sudden adult death syndrome.

In a statement, the 24-year-old's family said there was a "lack of medical awareness" about the syndrome.

"As a result, victim's families will continue to go unscreened and readily treatable warning signs missed."

"In life Dominic gave so much to others. It is up to us to ensure his legacy is not just a family immersed in our grief but that his loss brings awareness and change," they said.</text><tags>Cambridge, Ashford, University of Cambridge</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50813226<category>health</category><title>the year's big breakthroughs</title><text>It has been a remarkable year of promise in medical science - from inventing ways of treating the untreatable to reversing paralysis and keeping the brain alive after death.

He can now move all four of his paralysed limbs with a mind-controlled exoskeleton suit.

His movements, particularly walking, are far from perfect and the robo-suit is being used only in the lab.

But researchers say the approach could one day improve patients' quality of life.

A unique drug made for just one girl with unprecedented speed

Image copyright Boston Children's Hospital Image caption Mila had untreatable Batten disease until doctors designed a medicine just for her

Mila Makovec's doctors have performed a seemingly impossible feat - a girl with a deadly brain disease has been given a unique drug that was invented from scratch just for her and all in less than a year.

She was diagnosed with fatal and untreatable Batten disease.

The eight-year-old's medical team in Boston performed whole-genome sequencing - a detailed interrogation - on Mila's DNA, her genetic code, and uncovered a unique mutation that was causing her disease.

Having seen the fault, the researchers thought it might be possible to treat it.

They designed a drug, tested it on Mila's cells and on animals in the laboratory and won approval to use it from the US Food and Drug Administration.

Drugs normally take about a decade and a half to get from the laboratory, go through clinical trials and get to patients.

The US team got there in a year.

Mila is now having far fewer seizures, although she is not cured.

Gene-silencing drugs arrive

Image copyright Sue Burrell Image caption Sue Burrell no longer has severe bouts of pain

A new class of medicine - called gene silencing - has shown its ability to reverse previously untreatable diseases.

A gene is part of our DNA that contains the blueprint for making proteins, such as hormones, enzymes or raw building materials.

But our DNA is locked away inside a cell's nucleus and kept apart from a cell's protein-making factories.

So our bodies use a short strand of genetic code, called messenger RNA, to bridge the gap and carry the instructions.

Gene-silencing drugs kill the messenger.

Sue Burrell no longer has bouts of severe pain caused by her acute intermittent porphyria.

And Vincent and Neil Nicholas are both taking gene silencing medicines for a disease called amyloidosis.

Viruses to the rescue

Image copyright Jo Carnell Holdaway Image caption Isabelle Carnell Holdaway is taking a cocktail of viruses to fight dangerous bacteria in her body

Isabelle Carnell Holdaway's life was saved by an experimental cocktail of viruses.

The teenager's body was being attacked by deadly and seemingly untreatable bacteria and she was given less than a 1% chance of survival.

She had big, black, festering lesions forming on her skin where the infection was taking hold.

And she ended up in intensive care when her liver started failing, with large colonies of bacteria forming in her body.

But doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital attempted an untested "phage therapy", which uses viruses to infect and kill bacteria.

Phage-therapy never became mainstream medicine and the field was eclipsed by the discovery of antibiotics, which are much easier to use.

But now phage-therapy is having a resurgence due to the rise of superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics.

Isabelle's case could be the first of many.

A new approach to cancer

Image copyright Royal Marsden Image caption Charlotte Stevenson was treated with a tumour-agnostic drug

Charlotte Stevenson, a two-year-old from Belfast, was one of the first patients to benefit from a "revolutionary" new class of cancer drugs.

Tumour-agnostic drugs do not care where the cancer is growing in the body as long as it has a specific genetic abnormality inside.

The first, called larotrectinib, has been approved for use across Europe.

It is designed to target tumours with a genetic abnormality known as an NTRK gene fusion.

They can be found in Charlotte's sarcoma as well as some brain, kidney, thyroid and other cancers.

Meanwhile...

Cancer immunotherapy has reached a huge milestone.

The medicine uses a patient's own immune system to fight cancer and is a story we have followed closely.

Now more than half of patients are surviving a deadly skin cancer (melanoma) that was considered untreatable just a decade ago.

Ten years ago just one in 20 patients would live for five years after being diagnosed with late-stage melanoma. Most would die in months.

It has been an extraordinary and rapid transformation in care.

A first drug to slow dementia?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A pharmaceutical company says it has developed the first drug to slow Alzheimer's disease

A US pharmaceutical company says it has developed the first drug to slow Alzheimer's disease.

The drug, called aducanumab, is an antibody that clears toxic proteins that build up in the brain.

The announcement in October was a massive surprise, as the firm Biogen had written off the drug in only March this year.

Then it reviewed the evidence to show that those taking the highest dose did benefit and retained more memory and language ability and were better at day-to-day tasks such as cleaning, shopping and doing laundry.

If the drug is approved, which is not guaranteed, it would be one of the most significant moments in modern medicine.

A new type of dementia

Meanwhile, experts think they have found a new form of dementia and millions may have been wrongly diagnosed.

Dementia is a symptom found in many diseases of the brain and memory loss is the most common feature.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and others include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Now "limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy" or more simply "Late" has been added to the list.

Separating twins

One of our most followed stories of the year was the separation of two conjoined twins.

Safa and Marwa were born joined at the skull and they had never been able to see each other's faces.

There are no official figures for how often this happens, but one estimate says craniopagus conjoined twins are born once in every 2.5 million births.

Most do not live longer than a day.

To separate them required multiple surgeries, months of hard work and the expertise of hundreds of hospital workers.

Pig brains partially revived four hours after death

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The findings could lead to new treatments for brain damage

The line between life and death became fuzzy in 2019.

Pig brains were partially revived four hours after the animals were slaughtered.

The study showed the death of brain cells could be halted and that some connections in the brain were restored.

The feat was performed by rhythmically pumping a synthetic blood around the decapitated brains.

The surprise findings challenge the idea that the brain goes into irreversible decline within minutes of the blood supply being cut off and could lead to new treatments for brain damage and disorders.

However, there were no signals from the brain that would indicate awareness or consciousness.

A new tool to manipulate DNA

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Prime editing allows precise changes to be made to DNA

A new way of editing the code of life could correct 89% of the errors in DNA that cause disease.

The technology, called prime editing, has been described as a "genetic word processor" able to accurately re-write the genetic code.

It is a bit like pressing Ctrl-F to find the bit of text you want to change, then pressing Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V to copy over the new text (or the command key if you're a Mac user).

There are some 75,000 different mutations that can cause disease in people and the researchers say prime editing can fix nearly nine in 10 of them.

It has already been used to correct damaging mutations in the lab, including those that cause sickle cell anaemia and Tay-Sachs disease (a rare and fatal nerve condition).

Giving people a voice again

Image copyright Alamy Image caption Electrodes read the electrical activity in the brain

Scientists have developed a brain implant that can read people's minds and turn their thoughts to speech.

First an electrode is implanted in the brain to pick up the electrical signals that manoeuvre the lips, tongue, voice box and jaw.

Then powerful computing is used to simulate how the movements in the mouth and throat would form different sounds.

This results in synthesised speech coming out of a "virtual vocal tract".

It is not perfect.

If you listen to this recording of synthesised speech:

You can tell it is not crystal clear (the recording says "the proof you are seeking is not available in books").

The team at the University of California, San Francisco says the technology could help people when disease robs them of their ability to talk.

E cigarettes do help smokers quit

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There have been some 50 vaping and e-cigarette-related deaths in the US this year

Vaping has been under intense scrutiny this year.

More than 2,400 people have needed hospital treatment, and there have been 50 deaths, in the US from "e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury".

Meanwhile, a teenage boy nearly died after vaping caused a catastrophic reaction in his lungs.

But experts have continued to stress vaping is safer than smoking tobacco and this year came proof that vaping helps smokers quit.

A trial, in the New England Journal of Medicine, found 18% of smokers who used them to quit remained smoke-free after a year, compared with 9.9% of those using traditional nicotine-replacements.

Hundreds of birds found dead on a road may have been killed trying to escape a bird of prey, police have said.

More than 200 starlings were found dead on Anglesey on 11 December.

One of the birds had a tag from Lithuania, 1,032 miles (1,662 km) from where it was found dead.

North Wales Police's Rural Crime unit said investigations supported the theory they had hit the ground trying to avoid a predator.

Initial post-mortem examinations by the Animal Plant and Health Agency suggested the starlings had died on impact with the road.

One had a ring on its left leg and was ringed in 2015 Ventes Ragas, Lithuania, making it four years old.

"It's highly likely the murmuration took avoiding action whilst airborne, from possibly a bird of prey with the rear of the group not pulling up in time and striking the ground," a tweet from the unit said.

Mystery had surrounded the death of the birds with one starling expert suggesting they could have been disorientated by sun reflected from a wet road.

At the time Dafydd Edwards, whose partner found the birds, said it was as if "they had dropped down dead from the sky".

The force said it was waiting for further toxicology results before a final theory could be confirmed.</text><tags>Starlings, RSPB, Birds of prey, Birds</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49757660<category>technology</category><title>Amazon's Jeff Bezos promises climate-change action</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images

Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos has promised to make the company carbon neutral and meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement by 2040.

More than 1,500 Amazon employees have pledged to stage a "walkout" protest against the company's environmental record, on Friday.

It will be the first walkout by staff at Amazon's Seattle headquarters.

Organisers have welcomed Mr Bezos's promise but say it does not go far enough.

Mr Bezos said he hoped to make the company carbon neutral 10 years earlier than expected.

At a press conference in Washington DC, he announced the launch of a climate pledge any company can sign up to.

Its aim is to meet the targets set out in the Paris agreement by 2040, 10 years earlier than specified.

Greenpeace welcomed the announcement but said Amazon needed to end its use of fossil fuels.

"If Jeff Bezos wants Amazon to be a leader on climate, he needs to spell out exactly how it is going to rapidly move the company off of fossil fuels to keep our planet within the 1.5 degree temperature threshold in the Paris Agreement that Amazon has now committed to," the organisation said.

"Throwing money at carbon offsets and continuing to support the oil giants find even more oil is an early indication that Jeff Bezos doesn't understand the transition that is needed."

Promises

To meet its pledge, Amazon said it had ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles to reduce its fuel consumption. The first will enter service in 2021.

As well as its online shopping and delivery operations, Amazon operates vast data centres and cloud computing services.

According to the International Energy Agency, data centres were responsible for about 1% of the world's electricity use in 2018. And demand for cloud computing is expected to increase.

Image copyright Amazon Image caption Amazon has pledged to use more electric vehicles

Mr Bezos said 40% of the energy Amazon used was currently from renewable sources but this would rise to 100% by 2030.

Amazon will also invest $100m (&#163;80m) to restore forests and wetlands.

The company will also measure and report greenhouse gas emissions regularly.

"We want to use our scope and our scale to lead the way," said Mr Bezos in a press statement.

In June 2017, the Trump administration said the US would withdraw from the Paris climate accord.

But Amazon said it would meet the targets set out in the agreement 10 years "ahead of schedule".

In July, thousands of Amazon workers staged protests about pay and working conditions at the online retail giant.

The disruption was timed to coincide with Prime Day, when Amazon offers discounts and promotions.</text><tags>Climate change, Jeff Bezos, Amazon, Climate change</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50887982<category>world</category><title>Australia fires: The thousands of volunteers fighting the flames</title><text>Image copyright DANIEL KNOX/ANDREW O'DWYER Image caption Daniel Knox stands among flaming bushland during a controlled burn in NSW

"We're doing it because it's a passion. It's a brotherhood," says Daniel Knox.

"When that photo was taken of me, I had done a 15-hour shift out there."

He is one of thousands of Australians who've dropped their ordinary lives to battle the nation's raging fire crisis.

For weeks, the 22-year-old landscaper has lived around his phone, springing into action when called upon.

He is part of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (NSW RFS) which calls itself "the world's largest volunteer firefighting organisation". Its 70,000 members are extensively trained and, except for a few senior staff, mostly unpaid.

Mr Knox joined his local brigade in Sydney's south-west five years ago, when he was 17. He bonded with a senior member - Andrew O'Dwyer - over football and photography.

"He took me under his wing, looked after me and helped me out so much. The respect he gave me, a young bloke, even when I made mistakes... he was my brother," he told the BBC.

Last Thursday, Mr O'Dwyer and Geoffrey Keaton, the deputy captain at the Horsley Park Fire Brigade, were sent out late at night to a massive firefront.

Image copyright NSW RFS Image caption Volunteer firefighters Andrew O'Dwyer (left) and Geoffrey Keaton were both fathers to young children

En route their truck was hit by a falling tree, which caused it to roll. Three firefighters in the back seat were injured but were able to escape.

Mr O'Dwyer and Mr Keaton - both fathers to young children - were killed at the scene. They died five days before Christmas.

Earlier, bigger, more dangerous fires

Since September, close to 3,000 firefighters have been out every day in NSW battling blazes the size of small European countries.

Close to 90% of those people on the ground are unpaid volunteers, says the NSW RFS, the government-funded organisation leading the fight.

Image copyright LUCY BARANOWSKI Image caption Volunteers make up the majority of the firefighting crews battling Australia's fires

This century-old model is common across Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia - Australian states which have traditionally had bushfires each summer. In recent years, fires have also flared up in Tasmania and sub-tropical Queensland.

In NSW, most of the 2,000 or so brigades are found in country towns and rural centres dotted among eucalyptus bushland. Members are almost always locals, stepping in to save their own communities.

Historically, the work has tended to be patchy, which has been a key factor behind the volunteerism. Fires don't rage all year round, and there have been years when many areas aren't affected at all.

But this year, the situation has changed. Intense blazes typically seen in later summer have flared in spring, forcing authorities to wage full-blown campaigns earlier than ever before.

They're also dealing with hundreds more fires, burning simultaneously in hotter and drier conditions. NSW has been in drought for years, and fires are ripping through the state.

The monstrous Gospers Mountain blaze, an hour's drive north-west of Sydney, has spread to more than 450,000 hectares in size in less than a month. Officials now consider it to be potentially one of the largest fires ever recorded in Australia.

'Everyone's working so hard'

For weeks, Lucy Baranowski has been among the crews fighting that blaze, and others closer to her home in Kurrajong Heights. She and her partner took leave from their day jobs a few weeks ago - and are currently skating by on savings, credit cards and support from family and friends.

She misses her children - she evacuated them to her parents' home over a week ago. On Saturday, her crew helped save a friend's property - a success. But then the wind changed, and the crew could only watch on as the blaze tore through the neighbouring village of Bilpin.

The situation is extreme, but she has been buoyed by the "bubble of love" from her community, she tells the BBC.

Her friends have organised her children's Christmas presents. Others have manned shifts cooking and cleaning for crews at the station. A prolific blogger, her latest posts about her fireground days have gone viral on social media.

Image copyright LUCY BARANOWSKI Image caption Lucy Baranowski and her husband have been fighting the fires day after day

"So many people aren't making an income but are putting every part of their passion and blood into this campaign - it's really, really rough on a lot of people," she says.

She describes the RFS as her family - and in her case this is a literal statement. Out on the fireground she's standing alongside her father and her younger brother, as well her friends, her neighbours, all of them communicating via radio.

They've been running on adrenalin, but the prospect of a drawn-out summer and a seemingly endless fire front is weighing on all of them.

"You can just hear the fatigue in their voices and almost imagine their dirty, sweaty, ash-covered faces," she says.

"Everyone's working so hard to keep everything together but there's no rain forecast, and there's really nothing we can do to stop this fire."

"Do we start to give up hope now that this isn't going to stop?"

News of the firefighters' deaths at Horsley Park, only a 40-minute drive away, "shattered my heart" she says.

"I didn't know them - but that could have been my husband, my father, my uncle, my friend," she said. "After all this is over, we're probably going to fall down in a heap."

'What am I doing here?'

The mammoth, ongoing task has spurred a national conversation about support for firefighters.

The Labor opposition, town mayors, and a firefighters' union have called for them to be compensated.

"They volunteer as much as they can afford, sometimes even more than they can afford. It is not sustainable," says Mick Holton, president of the Volunteer Fire Fighters Association.

It often involves long hours, weeks away from paid work, and accruing expenses along the way. Earlier this year, Mr Knox travelled to the town of Tenterfield to help fight blazes there. It was an eight-hour drive from Sydney - he paid for his own petrol.

Public support for the "firies" is at an all-time high. In the swing of the Christmas season, shops and restaurants are donating profits to the NSW RFS. Online, there have been fundraisers to buy masks, food, and other supplies for the crews.

However, Australia's government has so far rejected the calls for compensation.

"Now is not the time to go into it. Let's get through this [bushfire crisis] first," said Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday.

A day later he announced the government, as a "model employer", would grant a minimum 20 days leave entitlement for public servants who went to the fires.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption An unidentified firefighter seen in the thick smoke and light of a bushfire near Sydney

"When people join these organisations, they do it to protect their community and do it out of a sense of great service," he has said.

That sentiment is what you hear from many firefighters. They're not motivated by money. They're reticent to speak up for any sort of handout. They've also been consumed with fighting the fires.

"People don't get it, people think how do you risk your life and not get paid for this stuff?" Mr Knox says.

"And yeah, there have been times when I've been in the thick of it, and it's so fierce you can't breathe. And I'm thinking to myself, what am I doing here?"

"But when you're on the truck, you're with your brothers," he said.

He took care of Mr O'Dwyer's young daughter when the prime minister visited the station on Sunday, to meet with her grieving mother.

He's proud of the photo he shared last week, which was taken in a controlled setting. That image of him standing in the middle of a flaming forest has gone viral. Mr O'Dwyer had helped him put the finishing touches on the edit.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Andrew O'Dwyer and Geoffrey Keaton were laid to rest in Sydney last week

"Everyone has a choice in life, in what they want to do when they wake up in the morning," says Mr Knox.

"I'd rather be out there firefighting - doing our part for the community. Making those two boys proud of us for getting back out there."</text><tags>Australia fires, Australia climate, Australia fires, Australia, Severe weather</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50951043<category>world</category><title>Australia fires: A visual guide to the bushfire crisis</title><text>Image caption More than 100 bushfires are still burning in New South Wales

Record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought have fuelled a series of massive bushfires across Australia.

Although recent cooler conditions and rain have brought some respite, more than 100 fires are still burning in the states of New South Wales and Victoria.

Some 28 people have so far been killed - including four firefighters - and an estimated 10 million hectares (100,000 sq km or 15.6 million acres) of bush, forest and parks across Australia has burned.

New South Wales and Victoria have been worst affected

In the worst-hit state, New South Wales (NSW), fire has affected more than five million hectares, destroying more than 2,000 houses and forcing thousands to seek shelter elsewhere.

There were 105 fires burning in the bush, mountain forests and national parks across NSW on 13 January, the Rural Fire Service said, with 38 uncontained.

Two large fires on the border between NSW and Victoria have merged into a so-called "mega blaze".

Victoria, where fires have burned 1.2 million hectares, extended a "state of disaster" for the worst-hit areas from 2 to 11 January, allowing authorities to enforce evacuations and let emergency services take over properties.

Three people - including one firefighter - have died in Victoria and around 20 fires are burning.

The military has sent troops, ships and aircraft to the region to help relocation and firefighting efforts.

What's Australia doing to fight the bushfires?

South Australia has also suffered

Two people and an estimated 25,000 koalas were killed when flames devastated Kangaroo Island in the state of South Australia last week

The island is renowned for its unique mix of animal species.

Experts have expressed concerns over the survival of endangered species on the island which include the dunnart - a mouse-like marsupial - and the black glossy cockatoo.

Tens of thousands of farm animals, mainly sheep, were also killed in the fire.

Videos posted on social media have shown efforts to rescue Koalas which survived the blazes.

Elsewhere in South Australia, the Cudlee Creek fire is reported to have destroyed more than 80 homes in the Adelaide Hills region.

Fires are also thought to have destroyed up to a third of the vines that provide grapes for the Adelaide Hills wine industry.

Smoke from fires has become a major hazard

The Australian capital Canberra - part of an administrative region surrounded by NSW - has seen some of the worst smoke pollution, with air quality rated the third worst of all major global cities on 3 January, according to Swiss-based group AirVisual.

Satellite images from 4 January show the spread of smoke from fires in Victoria and NSW, which has affected air quality as far away as New Zealand.

The fires have been worse than usual

Although Australia has always had bushfires, this season has been a lot worse than normal.

The total area of land affected by fires across Australia - 10 million hectares - is now comparable to England's land area of 13 million hectares.

Humans are sometimes to blame for starting the fires, but they are also often sparked by natural causes, such as lightning striking dry vegetation.

Once fires have started, other areas are at risk, with embers blown by the wind causing blazes to spread to new areas.

Bush fires themselves can also drive thunderstorms, increasing the risk of lightning strikes and further fires.

The number of people killed as a result of the fires since September 2019 is higher than in recent years.

Australia's deadliest bushfire disaster was "Black Saturday" in February 2009, when some 180 people died in Victoria.

If there is a serious risk of fire reaching homes or properties, authorities urge people to leave in good time as fire can travel fast - faster than most people can run.

So is this down to climate change?

Many Australians are asking that very question - but the science is complicated.

Scientists have long warned that a hotter, drier climate will contribute to fires becoming more frequent and more intense. Many parts of Australia have been in drought conditions, some for years, which has made it easier for the fires to spread and grow.

Data shows that Australia has warmed overall by slightly more than one degree Celsius since 1910, with most of the heating occurring since 1950, the Bureau of Meteorology says.

Australia broke its all-time temperature record twice in December. An average maximum of 40.9C was recorded on 17 December, broken a day later by 41.9C, both beating 2013's record of 40.3C.

By the end of the month every state had measured temperatures above 40C - including Tasmania, which is usually much cooler than the mainland.

A climate phenomenon is behind the heatwave

The main climate driver behind the heat has been a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) - an event where sea surface temperatures are warmer in the western half of the ocean, cooler in the east.

The difference between the two temperatures is currently the strongest in 60 years.

As a result, there has been higher-than-average rainfall and floods in eastern Africa and droughts in south-east Asia and Australia.

Andrew Watkins, head of long-range forecasts at the bureau, said the dipole was crucial to understanding the heatwave.

"The key culprit of our current and expected conditions is one of the strongest positive Indian Ocean dipole events on record," he says.

"A positive IOD means we have cooler than average water pooling off Indonesia, and this means we see less rain-bearing weather systems, and warmer than average temperatures for large parts of the country."

And meteorologists warn that, for the moment, the intense weather and elevated fire risk in Australia is set to continue.</text><tags>Australia fires, Australia climate, Australia fires, Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, Wildfires, Climate change</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51093999<category>health</category><title>Miscarriage can lead to 'long-term post-traumatic stress'</title><text>Image copyright Toni Edwards Image caption Toni with her daughter, Willow

One in six women who lose a baby in early pregnancy experiences long-term symptoms of post-traumatic stress, a UK study suggests.

Women need more sensitive and specific care after a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, researchers say.

Toni Edwards-Beighton, 36, says she felt she was losing her mind after a miscarriage in 2016.

"I felt my grief was wrong because it wasn't a real baby - but I was in complete shock," she says.

Warning: Some readers may find part of this article distressing

Toni and husband Matt, from Leicester, had been told their baby had no heartbeat at 12 weeks, before she miscarried naturally at home in the bathroom.

But she didn't expect to bleed heavily for eight days and then have to go through painful contractions.

"I thought I was going mad," she says.

"I had no information about what what would happen to me or what I could expect to see."

Panic and anxiety

In the end, something "recognisable and the size of a palm" fell between her legs in the middle of the night.

When she called the hospital the following day, they told her to "bring the pregnancy tissue in and we'll get rid of it".

"It wasn't 'tissue' to me, it was our baby," Toni says.

In the weeks that followed, she started to panic about everything, especially their daughter who was four at the time.

"I worried she was going to die - I could see her falling to the ground."

Months later, Toni's GP diagnosed her with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and offered her counselling - but she didn't go because by that time she was pregnant again.

"The following nine months were awful - I was convinced I'd lose my baby again," she says.

Toni and Matt now have two daughters, Phoebe who is eight and Willow who is two.

In the study of 650 women, by Imperial College London and KU Leuven in Belgium, 29% showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress one month after pregnancy loss, declining to 18% after nine months.

Most had been through an early miscarriage before 12 weeks - while the rest had had an ectopic pregnancy.

The women, who attended three London hospitals - Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea, St Mary's, and Chelsea and Westminster, completed questionnaires about their feelings over the course of a year.

One month following their loss, 24% had symptoms of anxiety and 11% of depression.

This reduced to 17% and 6% after nine months, the study in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology found.

Dr Jessica Farren, specialist registrar and clinical fellow at Imperial College London, said miscarriage could be a very traumatic experience.

"For some women, it's the first time they have experienced anything beyond their control.

"These can be profound events which stay with you."

Even though these losses are at a very early stage, "women are looking for validation for them", Dr Farren says.

Being told it's "only a bag of cells" is not always helpful.

Among a control group of women who had healthy pregnancies, 13% had symptoms of anxiety and 2% of depression one month after giving birth.

'Need for change'

The study recommends that women who have miscarried are screened to find out who is most at risk of psychological problems.

Counselling and support will help many women, but those with symptoms of PTS need specific treatment if they are going to recover, the research says.

This can range from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to medication, and should be given by a qualified professional.

An earlier, smaller study from 2016 found that early pregnancy loss could trigger symptoms of post-traumatic stress.

"For too long, women have not received the care they need following a miscarriage and this research shows the scale of the problem," says Jane Brewin, chief executive of miscarriage and stillbirth charity Tommy's.

"Miscarriage services need to be changed to ensure they are available to everyone and women are followed up to assess their mental wellbeing with support being offered to those who need it, and advice is routinely given to prepare for a subsequent pregnancy."</text><tags>Miscarriage, Mental health, Leicester, Pregnancy</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/business-11876811<category>business</category><title>BBC World News business headlines</title><text>Have Your Say</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-51142349<category>uk</category><title>Man strangled wife 'after suicide pact failed'</title><text>Image caption Doreen Virgo was found at Grays Fair Court care home near Norwich

A man with dementia strangled his wife after a suicide pact using rat poison went wrong, a court heard.

Michael Virgo, 81, of, Buxton, Norfolk, allegedly killed his wife Doreen, 89, on 12 July at a care home, in New Costessey, near Norwich.

The couple had agreed to "die together" but after the poison failed, Mr Virgo hit his wife over the head before strangling her, a trial of facts heard.

Mr Virgo had been charged with murder but was found unfit for trial.

Prosecutor Peter Gair said it was an "unusual and very sad case".

Mrs Virgo was found with a pillow over her face during a routine check around 19:30 BST by staff at Grays Fair Court care home.

She had blue stains around her mouth and blue residue was seen on a mug and plastic beaker in her room, Ipswich Crown Court heard.

'I killed her'

Mr Virgo was found by police in his car in Norwich later the same night.

He also had blue stains around his mouth and was taken to hospital where he told doctors: "My wife was taken ill, she was getting worse and worse, so I killed her" and "I didn't want to live without her".

The prosecution said there was "no evidence of a struggle" and it was possible Mrs Virgo had been "compliant".

Mrs Virgo, who had multiple sclerosis and was bed-bound, had previously told care home staff that her husband was the "only reason I am still here".

In a letter to his cousin following his arrest, Mr Virgo said: "Doreen and I had a wonderful, loving life and I am very sad to say that Doreen became so very unwell, we decided together to end our lives."

He said it was his "duty to assist her in her death" and "I miss Doreen more than anything in life and can't wait until we are together again". He also told a psychiatrist that his wife had been "pleading" for him to kill her.

Mrs Virgo's cause of death was recorded as strangulation.

The hearing continues.

What is a trial of the facts?

If a court determines that a person is unfit to stand trial, then criminal proceedings cannot proceed.

Prosecutors, however, have the option to have the matter heard as a "trial of the facts" in a public hearing to determine whether an accused committed the acts alleged.

It cannot result in a conviction, but if the court is not satisfied that the accused committed the acts alleged, then they will be acquitted.

The jury is not required to return a verdict of guilty or not guilty. Instead, they are asked to decide whether or not the accused committed the offence with which they were charged.

A number of different medical orders are available to the judge in the place of sentencing, as set out by legislation. These are mainly designed to protect the public.</text><tags>Costessey, Buxton</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-40325035<category>health</category><title>Cholesterol-lowering jab to help prevent heart disease</title><text>Image copyright BlackJack3D/Getty

Human trials of a cholesterol-lowering vaccine to help prevent heart disease are under way after successful studies in mice.

Researchers at the Medical University of Vienna are testing the safety of their experimental treatment in 72 volunteers.

The jab is designed to stop fatty deposits from clogging the arteries.

It would offer patients an alternative to taking daily pills to cut their risk of stroke, angina and heart attacks.

Booster jab

It will take years more of testing to know if the treatment will be safe and effective enough for human use, Dr Guenther Staffler and colleagues from The Netherlands Organisation of Applied Scientific Research say in the European Heart Journal.

Even if it does become available, in six years' time, it should not be seen as an excuse for people to avoid exercise and eat lots of high-fat food, they add.

The jab helps the body's immune system to attack a protein, called PCSK9, that would otherwise allow "bad" low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to build up in the bloodstream.

The researchers envisage that patients could have a yearly booster shot to top up their immunity.

In mice, the treatment cuts LDL cholesterol by up to 50% over 12 months and appears to protect against the build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries (atherosclerosis).

What is cholesterol?

Image copyright wildpixel/Getty Image caption Blocked arteries impede blood flow

Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in the blood. We all need it, but too much "bad" LDL cholesterol increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

"Good" high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, on the other hand, is beneficial because it helps transport other types of cholesterol from the blood to the liver, where it can be broken down.

Some people have high cholesterol because of an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolaemia.

Poor diet, high alcohol consumption, smoking and inactivity are also linked with high cholesterol.

Aren't there pills to reduce it?

People with high cholesterol can take cholesterol-lowering drugs, called statins, to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease.

But although these are very cheap and effective, they will not work for everyone.

Some people dislike taking daily medication or forget to take it because they are feeling well. Rarely, there can be side-effects.

Researchers have been looking at alternative treatment options that they can give to patients alongside or instead of statins.

What happens next?

Image copyright PETRA SPIOLA Image caption The vaccine induces immunity against a protein produced by the body, rather than something foreign

The first phase of testing on 72 human volunteers should be completed by the end of the year.

This will check if there are any safety issues or side-effects before more studies in people can begin.

There is a concern that the therapeutic vaccine might increase the risk of diabetes.

The researchers at the Medical University of Vienna who are conducting the human studies will be on the look out for this.

Dr Tim Chico, a cardiologist from the University of Sheffield, said: "Many questions remain about whether this approach could work in man.

"This is yet more proof that cholesterol causes heart disease, and lowering cholesterol reduces risk of heart disease, so it confirms the importance of a healthy lifestyle for everyone and medications such as statins for some people to reduce risk of heart disease."

Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, from the British Heart Foundation, said: "Finding new ways to manage people's cholesterol levels is absolutely vital.

"Although only tested in mice, this vaccine could lead to a simple way to target high cholesterol and ultimately reduce people's risk of heart disease."

The US and China have finally - after almost two years of hostilities - signed a "phase one" deal. But it only covers the easier aspects of their difficult relationship, and only removes some of the tariffs.

The biggest hurdles are still to come, and could stand in the way of a second phase agreement - one that would in theory remove all of the tariffs, bringing some much needed relief for the global economy, which is in the interests of all of us.

What's not in the phase one deal tells us where the flashpoints are in the US-China relationship - and what could derail the second round of negotiations.

So what didn't make it into the agreement?

1. Industrial subsidies and 'Made in China 2025'

The deal doesn't address Beijing's ambitious 'Made in China 2025' programme, which is designed to help Chinese companies excel and become world-class leaders in emerging technologies. It also doesn't address the subsidies that China gives its state-owned enterprises, says Paul Triolo of the Eurasia Group.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What is Beijing planning with its "Made in China 2025" programme?

Washington sees "Made in China 2025" as a direct threat to its supremacy in tech, saying that Chinese companies have only caught up with American ones - at times outpacing them - because they get unfair and outsized assistance from the Chinese government in the form of subsidies.

These were amongst the thorniest issues the Trump administration had with China, but they've been pushed to the phase two process Mr Triolo says, along with "market access in sectors such as cloud services, cyber security and data governance issues".

Beijing maintains it doesn't unfairly subsidise these industries or companies, but the reality is China isn't going to give up dominance in these sectors so easily.

2. Huawei

The trade deal won't reduce US pressure on Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant that has been caught in the crossfire of the trade war, with the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying the company isn't a "chess piece" in the negotiations.

That will disappoint both Huawei and the Chinese government which have been furious over how Washington has linked the company's fate to the relationship between the US and China.

The Chinese firm became a symbol of the US-China tech rivalry and Washington has been lobbying its allies - including the UK - to not use Huawei's 5G technology services in critical communications infrastructure, alleging it could be used by Beijing to spy on customers. Huawei has denied this and had hoped that if the US-China relationship improved, its fortunes would too.

Analysts tell me that's unlikely. With the signing of this agreement, there's a clear separation between national security and trade, and Huawei and other Chinese companies should still expect the pressure on them to continue. So expect more American export bans not just on Huawei, but on several more Chinese companies and increased US scrutiny on Chinese investments abroad.

3. Access for foreign financial services firms

While the agreement does talk about opening up market access for financial services firms, some analysts have said it doesn't go far enough to ensure they have equal market access.

China had already publicly said that it was opening up its financial services sector, and has recently allowed foreign companies to have a bigger stake in Chinese firms. But Beijing isn't giving up much by doing that, because China's financial services sector is now dominated by domestic digital payment players.

Even if US payment firms do have greater market access to the Chinese market, it's hard to see how they might be able to compete. Whether China sincerely applies its commitments to treat foreign and domestic firms equally will also be watched closely by the Trump administration, and this could be a potential area where the rapprochement could be derailed.

4. Enforcement and interpretation

The deal has a dispute resolution mechanism in place, which basically requires China - once a complaint has been made - to begin consultations with the US, with the onus on Beijing to resolve it.

But what the deal leaves out is "how the US is going to monitor enforcement," says Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute.

"American firms don't like to report intellectual property theft," he told me."So in the first instance what mechanism is the US using to gather information on this. All that is in the document is consultations."

The deal also leaves out how the two sides will interpret these key aspects of the agreement. Already, there are signs of differences. Chinese state media has suggested the dispute resolution mechanism isn't dictated by the US - not entirely in keeping with Washington's messaging.

This could indicate that even though there is an agreement in place, Beijing might ignore it, as Dan Harris of the China Law blog points out.

"The problem isn't the law," he says. "It's that when something is important to China - some cutting edge technology that it wants - then those laws don't have any use at all."

5. Further reductions in tariffs

The deal doesn't include a definitive timeline on when the tariffs that are still in place will go down.

According to research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, average tariffs on both sides are still up about 20% from pre-trade war levels - six times higher than when the dispute began. That means companies and consumers are still paying more.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who really pays in a tariff war?

Admittedly, the Trump administration has left the threat of tariffs in place as a stick to beat China with - in case Beijing doesn't keep to its commitments.

And there's always that risk, as China's hard line Communist Party mouth-piece the Global Times points out: "Can a preliminary trade agreement, reached during a period when China-US strategic relations are clearly declining, really work? Will it be replaced by new conflicts or further progress as negotiations continue?"

The potential for trade tensions to resume on both sides is still a very big possibility.</text><tags>Trump tariffs, China-US relations, China economy, China, Trade war, Donald Trump, United States, Huawei</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50673541<category>business</category><title>The accidental Singer sewing machine revolution</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images

Gillette adverts stand against toxic masculinity. Budweiser makes specially-decorated cups to encourage non-binary and gender-fluid people to feel pride in their identity.

These examples of so-called "woke capitalism"- of corporations promoting progressive social causes - may feel ostentatiously up-to-the-moment. But woke capitalism is not as new as you might think.

Back in 1850, social progress certainly had further to go.

A couple of years earlier, American campaigner Elizabeth Cady Stanton had caused controversy at a women's rights convention by calling for women to be given the vote. Even her supporters worried that it was too ambitious.

Meanwhile, in Boston, a failed actor was trying to make his fortune as an inventor.

He had rented space in a workshop showroom, hoping to sell his machine for carving wooden type. But wooden type was falling out of fashion. The device was ingenious, but nobody wanted to buy one.

The workshop owner invited the demoralised inventor to take a look at another product which was also struggling: a sewing machine. It did not work very well. Nobody had succeeded in making one that did, despite many attempts for many decades.

The opportunity was clear. True, the time of a seamstress was not expensive - as the New York Herald said: "We know of no class of workwomen who are more poorly paid for their work or who suffer more privation and hardship." But sewing took so much time - 14 hours for a single shirt - that there would be a fortune in speeding it up.

And it was not only seamstresses who suffered: most wives and daughters were expected to sew. This "never-ending, ever-beginning" task, in the words of contemporary writer Sarah Hale, made their lives "nothing but a dull round of everlasting toil".

In that Boston workshop, the inventor sized up the machine he had been asked to admire, and quipped: "You want to do away with the only thing that keeps women quiet."

50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.

It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.

That failed-actor-turned-inventor was Isaac Merritt Singer. He was flamboyant, charismatic, capable of great generosity - but ruthless, too.

He was an incorrigible womaniser who fathered at least 22 children.

Image copyright Getty Images

For years he managed to run three families, not all of whom were aware the others existed, and all while technically still married to someone else entirely. At least one woman complained that he beat her.

Singer was, in short, not a natural supporter of women's rights - although his behaviour might have rallied some women to the cause.

His biographer, Ruth Brandon, dryly remarks that he was "the kind of man who adds a certain backbone of solidity to the feminist movement".

Singer contemplated the prototype sewing machine.

"In place of the shuttle going round in a circle," he told the workshop owner, "I would have it move to and fro in a straight line, and in place of the needle bar pushing a curved needle horizontally, I would have a straight needle moving up and down."

Singer patented his tweaks, and started to sell his version of the machine. It was impressive: the first design that really worked. You could make a shirt in just an hour.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The first Singer sewing machine was patented in 1851

Unfortunately, it also relied on various other innovations which had already been patented by other inventors - such as the grooved, eye-pointed needle, to make a lock stitch, and the mechanism for feeding the cloth.

During the so-called "sewing machine war" of the 1850s, rival manufacturers seemed to be more interested in suing each other for patent infringement than selling sewing machines.

Finally, a lawyer banged their heads together, pointing out that between them were four lots of people who owned patents to all the elements needed to make a good machine. Why not license each other, and work together to sue everyone else?

More things that made the modern economy:

Freed from legal distractions, the sewing machine market took off - and Singer came to dominate it. That might have surprised anyone who had seen how his factories compared with those of his rivals.

Others had rushed to embrace what was known as the "American system" of manufacturing, using bespoke tools and interchangeable parts. Yet Singer was late to this party: for years his machines were made from hand-filed parts and store-bought nuts and bolts.

But Singer and his canny business partner, Edward Clark, were pioneers in another way: marketing.

Sewing machines were expensive, costing several months' income for the average family.

Clark came up with the idea of hire purchase: families could rent the machine for a few dollars a month - and, when their rental payments totalled the purchase price, they would own it.

It helped overcome the bad reputation built up by the slower, less reliable machines of bygone years. So did Singer's army of agents, who would set up the machine when you bought it, and call back to check it was working.

Still, all these marketing efforts faced a problem. And that problem was misogyny.

For a flavour of the attitudes Stanton was up against, consider two cartoons. One shows a man asking why you would buy a "sewing machine" when you could simply marry one.

In another, a salesman says women will get more time to "improve their intellects!" The absurdity was understood.

Image copyright Punch Cartoon Library / TopFoto

Such prejudice fuelled doubts that women could operate these expensive machines.

Singer's business depended on showing that they could, no matter how little respect he might have shown for the women in his own life.

He rented a shop window on Broadway in New York, and employed young women to demonstrate his machines - they drew quite a crowd.

Singer's adverts cast women as decision-makers: "Sold only by the maker directly to the women of the family." They implied that women should aspire to financial independence: "Any good female operator can earn with them $1,000 a year!"

By 1860, the New York Times was gushing: no other invention had brought "so great a relief for our mothers and daughters". Seamstresses had found "better remuneration and lighter toil".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A seamstress using a Singer sewing machine in 1907

Still, the Times rather undercut its gender-conscious credentials by attributing all this to the "inventive genius of man".

Perhaps we should ask a woman. Here's Sarah Hale, from Godey's Lady's Book and Magazine in 1860: "The needlewoman is&#8230; able to rest at night, and have time through the day for family occupations and enjoyments. Is this not a great gain for the world?"

There are plenty of sceptics about "woke capitalism" today. It is all just a ruse to sell more beer and razors, isn't it? Perhaps it is. Singer liked to say he cared only for the dimes.

But he is also proof that that social progress can be advanced by the most self-interested of motives.

US President Donald Trump has been impeached and now faces the next stage of a process that could, with enough support in Congress, see him removed from office.

It all centres on whether or not he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election in 2020.

Mr Trump became only the third president in US history to be impeached after two votes in the Democratic Party-controlled House of Representatives - but more on what that means below.

President Trump, who is a Republican, strongly denies any wrongdoing.

What is he accused of doing wrong?

President Trump is accused of pressuring Ukraine to dig up damaging information on one of his main Democratic challengers for the presidency in 2020, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter.

Hunter worked for a Ukrainian company when Joe Biden was US vice-president.

The president is accused of dangling two things as bargaining chips to Ukraine - withholding $400m of military aid to Ukraine that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting for Ukraine's president.

This, Democrats say, amounts to an abuse of presidential power, using the office for personal political gain and to the detriment of national security. Ukraine was using that money in its ongoing conflict with Russia.

Mr Trump is also accused of obstructing Congress by refusing to co-operate with the congressional inquiry.

What is the evidence against Trump?

A formal complaint from a whistleblower - an unnamed intelligence official who wrote a letter expressing concern about Mr Trump's 25 July call with President Volodymyr Zelensky - kicked off the impeachment process in early September.

A rough transcript of the call revealed that Mr Trump had urged President Zelensky to investigate discredited allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden.

The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of millions of dollars in US military aid to Ukraine. A senior official later testified that the president made clear the release of the aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated, but the White House denies this.

In a series of public hearings, a procession of US officials have testified that there was a White House shadow foreign policy led by the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.

Its aim was to get Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens and declare as much publicly.

What is his defence?

Mr Trump denies using US military aid as a bargaining chip with Mr Zelensky and has repeatedly insisted his call with Ukraine's leader was "perfect".

He has called the impeachment inquiry a "witch hunt" by Democrats and elements of the media.

He also says it was appropriate to ask Ukraine to investigate "corruption", referring to the energy firm where Hunter Biden worked.

The Republican defence comes in three parts:

- Ukraine's president said he felt no pressure

- The Ukrainians were unaware the aid was held back

- US military aid was eventually released

What is impeachment anyway?

To impeach, in this context, means to bring charges in Congress that will form the basis for a trial.

The US constitution states a president "shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanours".

It's important to note this is a political process, rather than a criminal one.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What does it take to impeach a president?

What is the process?

It happens in two stages.

The first stage is done now - two articles of impeachment (charges) were brought to the House of Representatives and passed in a vote along party lines.

Next the process heads to the Senate where a trial will be held in January.

But here, a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal - and this milestone has never been reached in US history.

The Senate is currently controlled by the Republican Party so conviction is considered unlikely in Trump's case.

Have other US presidents been impeached?

Bill Clinton found himself impeached on the grounds of perjury and obstruction of justice after he lied about the nature of his affair with Monica Lewinsky and then allegedly asked her to lie about it as well.

But when the trial reached the Senate in 1999, the vote for a conviction failed to get close to the two-thirds backing required.

The only other president impeached was Andrew Johnson in 1868. He was accused of, among other things, dismissing his secretary of war against the will of Congress. Mr Johnson had a narrow escape - the two-thirds majority in the Senate was missed by just one vote.

Richard Nixon, the 37th US president, resigned in 1974 before he could be impeached over the Watergate scandal.

Who would replace Trump?

The line of succession for the US government, as established by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, would mean Vice-President Mike Pence moving into the Oval Office.

Xavi says he turned down the offer to manage his former club Barcelona last week because the opportunity came "too early" in his coaching career.

The former Spain midfielder has been Al Sadd's boss since his playing career ended with the Qatari club in May.

He said Barcelona chief executive Oscar Grau and sporting director Eric Abidal offered him the manager's job before sacking Ernesto Valverde on Monday.

The La Liga leaders instead appointed former Real Betis boss Quique Setien.

"I did not agree to this offer, especially as it is too early for me to coach Barcelona," said Xavi, 39.

"But it will still be my dream to coach the team in the future."

Xavi, who made more than 750 appearances for Barcelona between 1998 and 2015, added that he "loves" Setien.

"I love the way he works and I expect him to succeed with the team," he said.</text><tags /></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50255191<category>business</category><title>Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?</title><text>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US and China are racing to capitalise on AI

"China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing," says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.

As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead.

The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies.

It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.

In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.

"What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era," said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.

These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.

The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for "unfair" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.

The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.

Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.

The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.

"That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice," US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.

China advances

As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.

The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China.

He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.

"In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."

He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry.

"In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen."

Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.

But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.

Scaling back

Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (&#163;3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.

High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans.

In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.

Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.

"Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them," he says. "They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options."

More Technology of Business

Will it work?

Prof Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.

In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.

"To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Prof Mitchell says some AI advances are win-win

While US concerns about technology theft have merit, "I feel like we're over-reacting," says Prof Mitchell.

"The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled," he says.

American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"Being hard on China is an easy political sell," he says, but warns that, "I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption AI technologies have sparked debate over surveillance and privacy

The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf.

The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.

At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are "de facto tools" of the state's Communist Party, saying they "have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally."

As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.

"To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies," he says.

For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.</text><tags>China-US relations, Asia Pacific, China, Artificial intelligence, Global trade</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-48606826<category>uk</category><title>Lyme disease has 'dominated' my life</title><text>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Morven-May MacCallum is still suffering nine years after starting treatment

Morven-May MacCallum says her life is still "completely dominated" by Lyme disease, nine years on from starting treatment.

About 200 people a year in Scotland are recorded with the disease but the true number is thought to be much higher.

The disease is a bacterial infection spread by a bite from an infected tick.

Scotland's chief medical officer has written to all of the country's NHS boards and GPs urging them to be vigilant about Lyme disease.

Catherine Calderwood's advice comes amid an increase in the number of cases of the debilitating condition

She said doctors should be alert to the risks if the patient has a history of walking in the outdoors in areas where there are ticks.

Ms Calderwood said it was hard for GPs because a patient's symptoms could be vague - tiredness, muscle ache, maybe a runny nose - and the likelihood of it being Lyme disease was quite small.

There is a distinctive rash which is shaped like a bullseye but not everyone gets one and this can make diagnosis tricky.

Health guidelines say for most people a course of antibiotics is an effective treatment but many claim they have a chronic form of the disease that persists with severe symptoms.

Such a condition is not widely accepted by doctors.

Image caption Morven suddenly became ill when she was 14

Morven-May, from the Black Isle, is now 26 but she was just 14 when she suddenly fell ill.

"I was hugely into mountain biking, horse riding, I'd go up Munros at the weekend," she told the BBC Disclosure programme Under The Skin.

"I was in training for climbing up the Mountain Morven up in Caithness. I was one of these really annoying people who never, ever stopped. I just kept going. I just bounced everywhere."

All that changed when what started off feeling like the flu became more serious.

She said: "I'd fall asleep in the school bus and I would come home and I would just collapse in a heap on the couch. I literally got up, went to school and collapsed in utter exhaustion each day.

"It got to the point where I had to leave school at 16 because by the time I got home from school each day I was so weak I couldn't physically walk."

Image caption Lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread by ticks

Her doctors believed she was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome but then a neighbour - who had experienced Lyme disease - intervened.

Morven-May said: "They'd seen me struggling to walk, and they said to my mother 'have you considered Lyme disease?'.

"She really researched it and she presented that research to the doctors and to specialists that I saw, and they refused again to accept that it could be Lyme disease because all my blood tests kept coming back as being negative."

It was eventually confirmed by a Lyme disease expert at a private clinic in England.

Morven-May said: "She clinically diagnosed me after investigating my history and then she ordered blood tests which went to America and to Germany, and they came back positive with Lyme disease."

It is now nine years since she started treatment but she said her life was still "completely dominated" by the disease.

"There's not a single second in which I feel like it's not in control of me, and that it's not monopolising my body," she said.

Lyme Disease

Image caption There is often a distinctive bullseye rash

Ticks that may cause Lyme disease are found all over the UK

High-risk areas include grassy and wooded areas in southern England and the Scottish Highlands

To reduce the risk of being bitten, cover your skin, tuck your trousers into your socks, use insect repellent and stick to paths

If you are bitten, remove the tick with fine-tipped tweezers or a tick-removal tool found in chemists

Clean the bite with antiseptic or soap and water

The risk of getting ill is low as only a small number of ticks are infected with the bacteria that cause Lyme disease

You don't need to do anything else unless you become unwell

You should go to your GP if you've been bitten by a tick or visited an area in the past month where infected ticks are found and you get flu-like symptoms or a circular red rash

These symptoms can include feeling hot and shivery, headaches, aching muscles or feeling sick

Source: NHS Choices

Lyme was only recorded for the first time in the 1970s, by doctors in the USA.

Reported cases are on the rise in the UK and and the Highlands have been identified as a hot spot for infections.

Dr James Douglas, a GP in Lochaber, regularly sees patients with the disease.

He told BBC Scotland's Disclosure that the tick bite would be the first obvious sign but if the bacteria went deeper into the body it could cause quite significant illness.

"It can affect primarily the nervous system, so it can start causing paralysis," he said.

"It can affect the joints and when it gets to this stage antibiotics certainly can get rid of the bacteria but in a percentage of people they're left with some really quite debilitating symptoms for quite some considerable time."

Image caption Dr Lucy Gilbert is a tick expert but a doctor refused to believe her about the Lyme disease

Dr Lucy Gilbert, from the University of Glasgow, is a leading expert on ticks and Lyme disease.

She said that when she was bitten her doctor refused to accept it could be Lyme disease.

Dr Gilbert said: "It was really frustrating, because I knew I had it. I'd found a tick on me, I knew it was the right type of tick, it had been on for at least 24 hours, it was from an area where I knew other people had got Lyme disease previously. I'd got the bullseye rash, which is supposed to be diagnostic."

Later, another doctor did prescribe intravenous antibiotics and she made a full recovery.

Most doctors say that definitive evidence of chronic or long-term Lyme disease has not been established.

Dr Douglas said there were "scientific uncertainties" in understanding how different people's immune systems responded to the bacterium.

He said: "I think what's happening is the bacteria is no longer there but I think their immune system is still very active and that's where they're getting these symptoms from because of the activity of the immune system, and almost the body kind of fighting itself."

Asda is launching a "sustainability store" where shoppers can fill their own containers with food.

Customers at a Leeds branch will be able to use refill stations for own brand rice and pasta, as well as Kellogg's cereals and PG Tips.

Asda is the latest major grocer to launch an initiative to cut down on plastic packaging.

UK supermarkets are responsible for 58 billion pieces of plastic a year, according to Greenpeace.

Asda uses about 65,000 tonnes of plastic a year.

The "sustainability store" will open in May at the Asda Middleton site in Leeds.

"We will be testing and learning from the customers in Middleton to understand how we can reduce our environmental impacts," said Asda chief executive Roger Burnley. "Our first priority will be to look at how we can reduce and remove plastic."

Daniel Webb, founder of campaign group Everyday Plastic, said the launch was also "a big step" for companies such as Kellogg's and Unilever whose products are included in the Asda trial.

'Naked florist'

In-store trials will last for at least three months, with customers asked to give feedback.

The store will house a "naked florist" selling plastic-free bouquets, and will also sell loose produce such as cucumbers or mushrooms without any plastic packaging.

In addition, the branch will have a "reverse vending machine" for recycling plastic bottles.

Asda recently committed to reducing plastic by 15% by February next year, as well as making all of its own brand packaging fully recyclable by 2025.

Single-use plastic has become a major topic for discussion after the BBC's Blue Planet II highlighted its effect on the oceans.

Major supermarkets have since pledged to cut down on their plastic waste.

The BBC has also announced plans for a year-long series of programmes and coverage on climate change, as part of the Our Planet Matters project.

What has been promised?

Waitrose has introduced refills for wine, beer, cleaning materials, and loose fruit and vegetables free from packaging across four stores after a trial at its Botley Road shop in Oxford.

It has also said it will remove all black plastic from its own label ranges, and stop selling single-use coffee cups.

This is an eye catching experiment from Asda.

It follows on from Waitrose and its trial which allows customers to fill their own containers with groceries. It received such a positive reaction from shoppers that its now being tested at three other stores.

Asda is taking things even further by selling products from some of our biggest brands.

There's clearly a growing demand for more sustainable shopping but the big question with both these schemes is it commercially viable to roll out nationwide?

Other pledges made by major UK retailers include:

Morrisons : Have 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025 and offer paper carrier bags

: Have 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025 and offer paper carrier bags Tesco : Remove hard-to-recycle materials, including PVC, from its own brand products

: Remove hard-to-recycle materials, including PVC, from its own brand products Sainsbury's : Remove lightweight loose product bags from store and replace plastic film on fruit and vegetables with a recyclable option

: Remove lightweight loose product bags from store and replace plastic film on fruit and vegetables with a recyclable option Aldi: Get rid of plastic wrapping on cabbages and cauliflower in some stores, and trial cardboard packaging on steak

Swiss-based global food giant Nestle also announced on Thursday it would invest up to &#163;1.6bn in making packaging for its food products recyclable.

Consumer concerns

Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said that Asda was another retailer reacting to "heightened consumer concerns about the environment".

He said: "It's a step in the right direction but we are at an embryonic stage in what is likely to be a very long journey. It will be a huge learning curve and one that tests the gap between what consumers say they 'want' and what they 'do' in reality."

Previous research by the environmental charity Greenpeace suggested Asda might have further to go than other supermarkets.

It was ranked ninth out of the UK's 10 biggest supermarkets for its plastic "footprint".

Louise Edge, head of Greenpeace UK's ocean plastics campaign, said that Asda's action was "encouraging".

But she argued that such schemes should be carried out more widely: "We'll never recycle our way out of this crisis, so Asda and other UK supermarkets must urgently reduce plastic by switching to reusable and refillable packaging at scale."</text><tags>Asda, Environment, Retailing, Recycling in the UK, Recycling, Companies, Plastic pollution, Plastic</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/51140473<category>sport</category><title>Masters 2020: Ali Carter to meet Shaun Murphy in the semi-final</title><text>This is Ali Carter's 12th appearance at the Masters but the first time he has reached the semi-finals

2020 Dafabet Masters on the BBC Dates: 12-19 January Venue: Alexandra Palace, London Coverage: Watch live across BBC Two, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button, Connected TV, the BBC Sport website and mobile app.

Ali Carter scrapped to a late-night 6-3 win over two-time champion John Higgins to reach the semi-finals of the Masters at Alexandra Palace.

Carter, 17th in the world rankings, is only in the event as Ronnie O'Sullivan decided not to enter, and made just one break of 50 or more in the match.

Higgins trailed 4-1 and although he pulled it back to 4-3, Carter kept his cool by taking the next two to advance.

He will face fellow Englishman Shaun Murphy, after he beat Joe Perry 6-3.

The evening match was slow going, but Carter took a frame lasting nearly half-an-hour to battle his way to a three-frame advantage.

Higgins responded with quick fire breaks of 140 and 73 to trail by one, but Carter snatched another long frame to go one from victory but with some controversy.

He missed an attempted safety on the yellow and the referee correctly called a foul, but Carter said he had hit the ball. Bulgaria's Desislava Bozhilova took the player's word and reversed her decision.

And he left his best until the last, making a frame-winning contribution of 72 to progress to the last four for the first time in his career.

Murphy into final four for first time since 2015

Former Masters champion Shaun Murphy reached the semi-finals for the first time in five years.

The 2015 winner struggled last season but has been close to his best this term, winning the China Championship in September.

He was in high-scoring form against Perry, making breaks of 51, 60, 66 and 120 to progress at Alexandra Palace.

After four frames, Murphy held a 3-1 lead and although Perry had a chance to hit back for 4-3, his break ended on 50.

That left 2005 world champion Murphy to clear the table before snatching the next frame to secure victory.

Shaun Murphy won the Masters in 2015 and lost in the final in 2012

"That was tough. Joe was so unlucky so many times, and but for that the match would've been a lot closer," said Murphy.

"I got up today and it was Masters quarter-final day. Deep down I'm still the 11-12-year-old that went to the [Wembley] Conference Centre dreaming of playing in it.

"It was a big match for me and I had not been in this situation for five years, but I would just like to be a little bit more clinical.

"Technically I'm a better player than I was five years ago, but I scored heavier then and I've only had one century break. If I could just up the scoring a bit, I would be happy."

The first round saw a number of high-profile casualties, including defending champion Judd Trump, UK Championship winner Ding Junhui, three-time world champion Mark Selby and Australia's Neil Robertson, while Ronnie O'Sullivan did not enter the tournament.

Perry, 45, who beat Ding 6-3 in his first-round match, was unhappy with his performance against Murphy and said: "There were simple shots I was messing up and I didn't get into any rhythm as I was chasing the cue ball around the table.

"They say the balls don't forgive you, I didn't miss lots but played a lot of bad shots, couldn't control the cue ball and found myself the wrong side of the balls and it snowballed out of control.

"It was not a great day at the office, but onwards and upwards."

On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.

Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.

His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.

He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.

"I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers," he says.

His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm.

In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.

Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.

Read more here.

Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.

In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware.

"Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power," says Mr Yue.

"If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view," Mr Yue says.

China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.

It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom.

But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China's President Xi Jinping wants to end the country's dependence on foreign chip suppliers

In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.

That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.

The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology.

In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (&#163;22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.

"There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones," questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.

More Technology of Business

"Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are," Mr Scaruffi adds.

Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies.

Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.

"To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features. The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world," says Mr Yue.

He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Huawei has been put on a US government blacklist

Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?

Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.

"You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has," says Mr Yue.

Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs.

"We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers," he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.

Image caption China aims to supply 70% of its demand for chips by 2025

Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.

But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.

Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. "Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power," says Mr Scaruffi.

He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.

"If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society," he says.</text><tags>China, Trade war, Apple, Huawei</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-51138659<category>uk</category><title>Leyton machete attack: PC was 'fighting to stay alive'</title><text>Image copyright Met Police Image caption PC Stuart Outten suffered several injuries including six wounds to the head

A police officer was fighting to "stay alive" when he was attacked with a machete during a routine stop in east London, a court has heard.

PC Stuart Outten, 29, was stabbed in the head as he tried to arrest Muhammad Rodwan in Leyton on 7 August last year.

The Old Bailey heard he had sent a text earlier that night saying he was "off to cause trouble".

Mr Rodwan, 56, of Luton, admits striking the PC but denies attempted murder, claiming it was self defence.

PC Outten suffered six wounds to the head, skull fractures, injuries to the arm and broken fingers, the jury has been told.

Image copyright Julia Quenzler Image caption Muhammad Rodwan denies attempted murder

Giving evidence, the Met PC told the court he was "on the lookout" for traffic offences during a night shift when he came across a "suspicious" white van which he thought could be without insurance.

PC Outten said Mr Rodwan had appeared "extremely angry" at being stopped and tried to make off but he used his leg to stop the 56-year-old closing the van door.

"I tried to say 'you're not leaving' and then the defendant punched me twice to the face," he said.

The officer told the jury he "grabbed" Mr Rodwan by the belt, neck and dreadlocks "to incapacitate him" but the 56-year-old lunged into the van.

The officer said he then felt "something sharp being snapped against my head" and realised he was being attacked with a 2ft (60cm) long rusty machete.

PC Outten said he then stumbled away and "gave a quick command of 'police with Taser'," before he fired it.

When he was asked why he fired, the officer replied: "To stop myself being attacked with a machete and save my own life."

Earlier that night, he had sent a text to his girlfriend, who is also a police officer saying: "Right I'm off to cause trouble. Stay safe and I will chat when I can."

Defence barrister Michael Turner said he was "sure you will say it is an ironic comment in a sense after what happened that night".

Image caption The PC said he had been "on the lookout" for traffic offences when he came across a "suspicious" white van

Jurors were also shown a video of the attack taken from mobile phone footage and officers' bodycams during which Mr Rodwan could be heard before he was Tasered by the heavily bleeding officer.

Mr Rodwan denies attempted murder, an alternative of wounding with intent, and possessing an offensive weapon.

British Airways' owner IAG has filed a complaint to the EU arguing Flybe's rescue breaches state aid rules.

The move comes amid a growing backlash against the government's plan to defer some of Flybe's air passenger duty payments, thought to top &#163;100m.

EasyJet and Ryanair said taxpayer funds should not be used to save a rival.

Meanwhile, the government's proposal to cut Air Passenger Duty (APD), was attacked by the rail industry's trade body and climate campaign groups.

EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: "Taxpayers should not be used to bail out individual companies, especially when they are backed by well-funded businesses."

While Ryanair said it had called for "more robust and frequent stress tests on financially weak airlines and tour operators so the taxpayer does not have to bail them out".

The government has said the review of the tax will be consistent with its zero-carbon targets.

However, in a tweet, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said: "Addressing Flybe problems by reducing APD on all domestic flights is utterly inconsistent with any serious commitment to tackle the Climate Crisis. Domestic flights need to be reduced, not made cheaper."

The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, also said any review of APD "that encourages more people to fly domestically would limit efforts to tackle the climate crisis".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Willie Walsh, the chief executive of the owner of British Airways, said government money should not have been used

Ahead of filing the state aid complaint, Willie Walsh, the outgoing chief executive of IAG, wrote to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, criticising the government's involvement in its rescue.

In a letter, Mr Walsh said: "Prior to the acquisition of Flybe by the consortium which includes Virgin/Delta, Flybe argued for tax payers to fund its operations by subsidising regional routes.

"Virgin/Delta now want the taxpayer to pick up the tab for their mismanagement of the airline. This is a blatant misuse of public funds.

"Flybe's precarious situation makes a mockery of the promises the airline, its shareholders and Heathrow have made about the expansion of regional flights if a third runway is built."

But Downing Street has said the government is "fully compliant" with state aid rules. The Prime Minister's spokesman said "there has been no state aid to Flybe," adding that "any future funding will be made on strictly commercial terms."

British Airways' owner IAG's decision to make a state-aid complaint to the European Commission underlines its determination to shine a light on - and if possible, overturn - the government's assistance to Flybe.

Ministers have not published the details of the arrangement, but it is understood to include a "time-to-pay" arrangement for the company's airline passenger duty liabilities.

These arrangements are common for companies that are struggling to pay their tax, but unusual when it comes to duty payments.

IAG chief executive Willie Walsh's letter to Grant Shapps points out that Flybe has wealthy backers - Virgin Atlantic is a big shareholder, and one of Virgin's main shareholders in turn is Delta Air Lines, one of the biggest and most profitable airlines in the world. These are not the kind of companies, Mr Walsh argues, that should rely on taxpayer support to keep one of their investments trading.

His intervention should, of course, be seen in the light of the long and bitter commercial rivalry between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. The latter's position at Heathrow is bolstered by Flybe's feed of domestic traffic, and BA would not be unhappy if that stream of traffic was choked off.

'Necessary' move

Three Cabinet ministers - Mr Shapps, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom and Chancellor Sajid Javid signed off on the deal that will keep Flybe operating.

Although the terms of the direct assistance were not disclosed, they are understood to include forbearance on Flybe's Air Passenger Duty (APD) payments.

Mr Shapps said the move was necessary to protect key routes and any rule changes would apply to all carriers.

"The actions we have taken will support and enhance regional connectivity across the UK, so local communities have the domestic transport connections they rely on," he said.

"Any changes implemented as a result of our reviews of air passenger duty and regional connectivity will apply to all airlines in the competitive aviation market."

What are EU state aid rules?

State aid is assistance given by the government to companies or other organisations that has the potential to distort market competition.

The aid can be in the form of direct cash grants or indirect aid - such as preferential borrowing rates or tax credits.

Under EU rules, member-state governments are allowed to provide state aid only with approval from the European Commission.

For example, in 2015 the UK government submitted plans to provide a subsidy to Drax power station to convert one of its units from coal to biomass fuel. Following an investigation, the commission ruled in favour of the scheme.

But there are exceptions to the rules. For example, aid worth less than 200,000 euros (&#163;175,000) over three years is exempt.

Even though Brexit is due to happen on 31 January, the UK will continue to follow EU state aid rules during the 11-month transition period that follows.

IAG believes the UK government's proposal would amount to unlawful state aid as it would impact other airlines operating the same routes as Flybe, but the government disagrees.

Airlines collect the duty from passengers as part of their ticket price, and then hand it over to HMRC.

It is understood Flybe could be given up to three months' breathing space to pay about &#163;100m worth of duty.

The ministers have also agreed to review air passenger duties on domestic flights in a move attacked by environmental campaigners.

Ms Leadsom defended the decision to intervene, saying that Flybe was a "viable business".

She also said Flybe's situation was different to that faced by travel firm Thomas Cook, which collapsed last year. "The difference... between Flybe and Thomas Cook was that in the case of Thomas Cook it had huge amounts of debt, and any taxpayer's money would simply be throwing good money after bad."

Profitable owners

Flybe's owners - Virgin Atlantic, Cyrus Capital and Stobart Air - will inject about &#163;30m of new money.

In his letter, Mr Walsh pointed out that Virgin is part-owned by US carrier Delta Air Lines, which is one of the world's largest and most profitable airlines.

He argues that Virgin and Delta together have the resources to rescue Flybe, and they should not be asking for taxpayer support. Mr Walsh says Flybe has been mismanaged.

Flybe is already in receipt of some public money for its important Newquay-Heathrow route, which it operates under a "public service obligation" contract with the government.

Mr Walsh said that British Airways had indicated its willingness to operate that route without assistance - in the summer only - but was excluded because of the Flybe deal.

He warned the government that Flybe's Heathrow operations could, in time, be diverted to long-haul routes - which would not be in line with its policy of promoting regional connections to London.

Jobs saved

But Rob Griggs, director of policy at Airlines UK, the industry trade body, defended the deal. He said giving extra time to Flybe to pay APD was not the same as a direct injection of public funds.

The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), a union, also welcomed the news.

"This is good news for 2,400 Flybe staff whose jobs are secured and regional communities who would have lost their air connectivity without Flybe," said Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton.

Lucien Farrell, the chairman of Connect Airways - which owns Flybe - said the group had agreed to "keep Flybe flying with additional funding alongside government initiatives".

"We are very encouraged with recent developments, especially the government's recognition of the importance of Flybe to communities and businesses across the UK and the desire to strengthen regional connectivity," he said.</text><tags>Exeter, Air travel, Aerospace, Companies, IAG, Transport, British Airways, Flybe</tags></news_id><news_id>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50648325<category>health</category><title>'Check your cholesterol from age 25'</title><text>Image copyright BlackJack3D/Getty

People should have their cholesterol level checked from their mid-20s, according to researchers.

They say it is possible to use the reading to calculate the lifetime risk of heart disease and stroke.

The study, in The Lancet, is the most comprehensive yet to look at the long-term health risks of having too much "bad" cholesterol for decades.

They say the earlier people take action to reduce cholesterol through diet changes and medication, the better.

What is cholesterol?

Cholesterol is a fatty substance - a lipid - found in some foods and also produced in the liver.

We need it to make hormones such as oestrogen and testosterone, as well as vitamin D and other compounds.

There are two types:

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is "good" because it helps the body stay healthy

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is "bad" because it can clog the arteries

What did the researchers find?

They analysed data from almost 400,000 people from 19 countries and found a strong link between bad-cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease from early adulthood over the next 40 years or more.

They were able to estimate the probability of a heart attack or stroke for people aged 35 and over, according to their gender, bad-cholesterol level, age and risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, height and weight, and blood pressure.

Report co-author, Prof Stefan Blankenberg, from the University Heart Center, Hamburg, said: "The risk scores currently used in the clinic to decide whether a person should have lipid-lowering treatment only assess the risk of cardiovascular disease over 10 years and so may underestimate lifetime risk, particularly in young people."

Up to eight million people in the UK take statins, which lower levels of bad cholesterol in the blood.

It is estimated one in every 50 people who takes the medication for five years will avoid a heart attack or stroke as a result.

An active lifestyle and a healthy diet can also reduce cholesterol.

Should people be taking statins in their 30s?

Not necessarily. The researchers stop short of recommending any adult with high cholesterol levels should pop a pill.

Prof Blankenberg told BBC News: "I strongly recommend that young people know their cholesterol levels and make an informed decision about the result - and that could include taking a statin."

But he added there was a danger people would rely on statins rather than leading a health lifestyle and although they were usually well tolerated, studies had not been done on the potential side-effects of taking them over decades.

British Heart Foundation medical director Prof Sir Nilesh Samani said: "This large study again emphasises the importance of cholesterol as a major risk factor for heart attacks and stroke.

"It also shows that for some people, taking measures at a much earlier stage to lower cholesterol, for example by taking statins, may have a substantial benefit in reducing their lifelong risk from these diseases."

Rugby League World Cup 2021 Dates: 23 October to 27 November 2021 Coverage: All 31 matches of the men's World Cup will be broadcast live by the BBC, with at least 16 games on BBC One or BBC Two.

Hosts England have been drawn alongside Samoa, France and Greece in the group stage of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup.

England will play Samoa in the opening match of the tournament at St James' Park, Newcastle on 23 October.

Australia, who beat England in the 2017 final, are in Group B and have been drawn with Fiji, Scotland and Italy.

Meanwhile, 1995 and 2000 semi-finalists Wales have been drawn alongside Tonga, Papua New Guinea and the Cook Islands.

New Zealand, who were knocked out by Fiji in the 2017 quarter-finals, will face Lebanon, Jamaica and Ireland.

The Duke of Sussex, Jason Robinson and Dame Katherine Grainger conducted Thursday's draw at Buckingham Palace.

The draw was the first public appearance that Rugby Football League patron Prince Harry has made since announcing last week that he was stepping away from senior royal duties.

The 2021 World Cup will be the first time in the sport's history that the men's, women's and wheelchair events will be staged concurrently.

The men's and women's finals will also be played as a double header at Old Trafford, Manchester, on 27 November.

England will get the women's tournament under way when they take on Brazil at Headingley, Leeds, on 9 November.

The hosts have also been drawn alongside Papua New Guinea and Canada, while in Group B, holders Australia will take on New Zealand, France and the Cook Islands.

Finally, in the wheelchair World Cup, England will open the tournament against Australia on 11 November at London's Copper Box Arena, with Spain and Norway making up the rest of their group.

France, Wales, Scotland and the United States form Group B, with the final taking place at Liverpool's M&amp;S Bank Arena on 26 November.

Jon Dutton, chief executive at Rugby League World Cup 2021 said: "We want to deliver a truly world class event next year and we're really excited by the first three fixtures that have come out from today's draws.

"We look forward to announcing the full schedule of games along with ticket prices in the next few months."

Prince Harry 'in jovial mood'

Analysis: BBC Sport's Shamoon Hafez at Buckingham Palace

Newspapers and news bulletins have been filled with reaction to last week's announcement made by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex that they intend to step back as senior royals and split their time between the UK and Canada.

But Prince Harry was in jovial mood as he attended Buckingham Palace to conduct the 2021 Rugby League World Cup draw. He was not doing any media interviews but a cheeky journalist shouted out: "Harry, how are talks going about your future?" He brushed off the question with a loud laugh.

Inside, he met with representatives from all 21 nations competing in the event next year. Comedian Adam Hills was there for Australia and Prince Harry commented on Hills' beard, saying: "One of the best manicured and styled beards I have ever seen."

He was all smiles during the draw itself, getting a good laugh from the watching crowd when he made the point of stirring the balls in the pot and then hiding his face.

Can England win on home soil?

The 2021 tournament is the first time that England have hosted the event since 2013, when they lost to New Zealand in agonising fashion in the semi-final.

Shaun Johnson touched down with a last-minute try as the then-defending champions stunned a vociferous home crowd at Wembley.

That defeat marked the third time in a row that England were eliminated at the semi-final stage at a World Cup, with all of their losses coming against the Kiwis.

Under head coach Wayne Bennett, England reached their first final for 22 years in 2017. However, they were defeated by hosts Australia in a tightly-fought final which saw the Kangaroos narrowly win 6-0.

Going into 2021, it is still unclear whether Bennett will lead England into the tournament, having overseen a winless Great Britain Lions tour of New Zealand, which saw the side lose all four of their matches, including both Tests against the Kiwis.

A Brazilian judge has ordered the closure of the venues built for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro over safety concerns.

The city's authorities had not provided safety guarantees for the Olympic Park to hold public events, the judge said.

In 2016, the site hosted basketball, swimming and tennis competitions. It is now used for concerts and other events.

But parts of it have been poorly maintained. The Games were criticised for their cost and alleged corruption.

A number of investigations have been opened into claims of corruption in the construction of venues and infrastructure related to the event, the first to be held in South America. In 2017, the cost of hosting it was estimated at around $15bn (&#163;11bn in current figures).

The Olympic Park in the western Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood is a sprawling complex that includes a velodrome, aquatics and tennis centres and several arenas. It is now a public park, and hosts events including music festivals and e-sports tournaments.

But even before the Games were held, critics argued the sites were too big and expensive to maintain in the long run, warning that some risked becoming "white elephants" like several of the arenas built in Brazil when it hosted the World Cup in 2014.

Judge Eugenio Araujo ruled in favour of a request from the Rio prosecutor's office asking for a ban on all major events at the facilities until authorities had seen certificates demonstrating their safety. He said the place was "progressively battered by the lack of care" and "ready for tragedies".

The federal government is responsible for most of the venues while some are administered by city authorities, the Brazil Olympic Committee and private companies.

An entrepreneur charged with managing the oil wealth of the struggling African state of Angola was paid more than $41m in just 20 months, leaked documents reveal.

The payments were made via a complex web of companies set up in the offshore jurisdiction of Mauritius.

Jean-Claude Bastos also used his position to help set up large investment deals he stands to further profit from, the Paradise Papers show.

All sides deny any wrongdoing.

Like many oil rich countries, Angola set up a sovereign wealth fund to invest the proceeds of its natural resource wealth. Similar schemes have been used by other countries to help ensure a steady income for future generations.

Angola is wracked by corruption, suffers extreme poverty and has one of the highest child mortality rates in the world.

The fund, Fundo Soberano De Angola (FSDEA), which began with $5bn (&#163;3.75bn) in 2011, was mired in controversy from the start, after the then Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos' son, 39-year-old Jose Filomeno, was appointed to head it up.

Jean-Claude Bastos, sometimes also known as Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais, a Swiss-Angolan and close friend of the then president's son, was chosen as the fund's asset manager.

Typically, a fund of this size would spread the risk of investment among several asset managers, along with the fees it pays, said one expert.

Paradise Papers - Tax secrets of the ultra-rich

However, Mr Bastos was given responsibility for investing almost all of the fund's money, and was paid accordingly. Today, his company Quantum Global Investments Africa Management, manages about 85% of it.

One expert described the situation as "unusual". Andrew Bauer, an authority on sovereign wealth funds, told the BBC: "Funds want to hedge the risk. You don't want to put all your eggs in one basket."

In a statement, the FSDEA told the BBC the appointment of Mr Bastos' company to manage the fund followed "an objective process". The firm was selected, it said, because of its "exemplary performance on previous mandates with the Angolan authorities".

The fund also said giving near total control of investments to one asset manager was part of its policy for the first 18 months only.

Documents seen by the BBC as part of the Paradise Papers investigation show the fund paid management fees of more than $90m (&#163;67.5m) to Mr Bastos' Mauritius-based QG Investments Africa Management. This occurred over a 20-month period between May 2014 and the end of 2015.

Source document

The leak offers an unprecedented view into what happened to the management fees after being paid into Mr Bastos' company.

This money was split into two main chunks - with $41m declared as dividends, or pure profit, and deposited in a company in the British Virgin Islands, itself owned by a series of secretive offshore companies ultimately owned by Mr Bastos. A further $34m was paid in advisory fees to a Swiss firm majority owned by Mr Bastos. The rest, after minor expenses, was retained in the management company run by Mr Bastos.

The BBC asked Mr Bastos whether secrecy was the reason for the series of companies registered offshore. He said it was entirely his personal choice how he receives dividends from his companies. He also said the dividends he receives "pale in comparison to the long term positive impact my projects will have in Angola".

Both the fund and Mr Bastos said the management fees paid to Quantum Global Investments Africa Management are in line with global industry standards.

Mr Bastos added that the level of work provided by the group is considerable to ensure projects are built for future success.

Within months of receiving the money, a company in which Mr Bastos is a director purchased a 14-seater jet that had been priced at $31.75m. Mr Bastos told the BBC his is one of "many businesses that own an aircraft to more efficiently manage their travel requirements" and that travelling on commercial flights is "unproductive".

The leaked documents also show Mr Bastos holds a personal stake in investments the fund made on his recommendation.

In one, tens of millions were committed to a deal with another of Mr Bastos' companies, Afrique Imo Corporation, to build a hotel, office and a retail complex in the Angolan capital, Luanda.

The deal represents a "very strong conflict of interest" according to Mr Bauer. "This absolutely should not be happening."

At the time, it sounded alarm bells in the compliance department of Appleby - the law firm that handled the investment, according to internal emails seen by the BBC. In one, sent from a regional compliance manager, a team member charged with making sure the deal was above board noted: "this poses issues of conflict of interest between the Manager, Fund and the Investee Company".

However, an email from Appleby's director back to the compliance team notes Mr Bastos had "disclosed his interest" and, in a board meeting convened to agree the hotel deal, had "abstained from voting". Crucially, though, the director notes Mr Bastos "was still present in the meeting", before adding: "For the purpose of managing the conflict, Mr Bastos should refrain from attending any meeting."

Source document

On seeing the confidential emails of the exchange, Tom Keatinge, a specialist in financial crime, told the BBC he was "sure they are going to come to a conclusion that this is not a transaction that they should be approving".

Appleby "provide[d] the client with the answer that he wanted", said Mr Keatinge. "It's hard to believe that just because he abstained from the voting, his views were not well understood by the meeting. So it's a scurrilous approach in my view."

As well as the Luanda complex, two other investments made for the fund in that period carried similar apparent conflicts of interest for Mr Bastos, according to the Appleby documents.

Mr Bastos told the BBC that where he holds a stake in investments, he views these investments as "having aligned interests" and not being "conflicted".

Political elite

The FSDEA said its investment policy for the first 18 months encourages "close interrelation and synergies... to increase the speed of portfolio development and boost institutional reach".

There are also questions about whether the hotel project represented a good investment for the fund. A former employee of Quantum Global with a direct knowledge of the Luanda deal said in 2016 the project was assessed as "economically unviable" because it would not bring good enough returns for the fund. The investment advisers' recommendation was to drop it.

Mr Bastos insisted the investment was viable and said that "by developing what will become Angola's tallest building his group are demonstrating their belief in the long term potential of the Angolan economy".

Image copyright STRINGER Image caption In Luanda in 2016, rubbish went uncollected after the refuse company was not paid

The web of companies run by Mr Bastos would appear to be designed to "to enrich a particular individual or... group of people", said Mr Keatinge.

"Whoever has oversight of this structure... the political elite within Angola, there is either massive incompetence or there is complicity here."

Appleby, which is the focus of much of the Paradise Papers investigation, didn't respond to specific questions about Mr Bastos - citing client confidentiality. The firm which denies any wrongdoing says it "advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business".

Another document seen by the BBC raises questions for the authorities in Mauritius, after an internal report by another offshore regulator criticised Mr Bastos. The regulator in Jersey notified Mr Bastos that his application to run the asset management business was likely to be refused because it doubted his independence. It highlighted Mr Bastos' "close association" with the fund's chairman, Jose Filomeno Dos Santos, and a conviction in Switzerland for "qualified cases of misappropriation".

Source document

Mr Bastos told the BBC he withdrew the application before any formal decision was made by the Jersey regulator.

A little more than a month later Mr Bastos applied successfully in Mauritius. He told the BBC he informed the Mauritian authorities about his conviction which in any case had expired and that his "criminal record is completely clean".

The BBC asked the Financial Services Commission in Mauritius how it satisfied itself Mr Bastos was a fit and proper person to be licensed.

It declined to comment on the case but said where there were "adverse" issues disclosed in an application, the handling law firm - in this case Appleby - would be responsible for checking.

Again, Appleby declined to comment on individual cases.

A seven-year-old boy, who will receive an award from Prince Harry next week, is battling cancer for a third time.

Laughlin Whiteley, of Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, had his illness charted in his father's blog after he was found to have a brain tumour, aged four.

In February he had a stem cell transplant for a rare leukaemia and was given the all-clear but has suffered a relapse of the blood cancer.

His father John said the award was a "fantastic recognition of his courage".

National charity for sick children WellChild has named Laughlin as its Most Inspirational Child of the Year after receiving hundreds of nominations for the title.

Its patron Prince Harry is due to give Laughlin, who is also known as Lockey, his award at a London hotel on Monday.

"We're absolutely thrilled," said Mr Whiteley.

Image copyright John Whiteley Image caption Mr Whiteley has helped his son set up a charity for other young cancer sufferers

"He was nominated by about a dozen different people - those who work with him.

"It was very clear from the range of people and the things they said that it was about his ability to battle illness over a long period of time and his interest in sharing what he has found to be good.

"It is a fantastic recognition of his courage."

Laughlin, together with his father and mother Andrea, set up a charity earlier this year to distribute craft boxes to children at Great Ormond Street Hospital, where he is being treated.

Unlock a Life for Lockey also provides a beach hut for young cancer sufferers at Walton-on-the-Naze and the organisation would like to buy a chalet on the Norfolk or Suffolk coast.

Doctors now hope to give Laughlin another stem cell transplant using an umbilical cord from Holland.

He has started a course of mild chemotherapy and doctors want to do the transplant once he is fit enough.

"We've been lucky to have been offered a second transplant," said Mr Whiteley.

"The type of leukaemia Laughlin has is susceptible to cord transplants.

Donald Trump has become only the third US president to be impeached by the House of Representatives.

We answer your questions on the impeachment charges brought against the president.

When will the trial take place in the Senate? - Kamran Norell, Birmingham, UK

Nothing is set in stone yet, but the general consensus is the Senate will start its trial perhaps as early as the second week in January, when it returns from its winter recess.

That's what Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, has requested.

And while Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell may not like some of his counterpart's other requests for trial procedures, he may be OK with this timeline.

Will Trump have to testify in the Senate trial? - James Mooney, 34, Craigavon Northern Ireland

There is nothing requiring a president to testify in his or her own defence during a Senate trial. Neither Bill Clinton nor Andrew Johnson did so in their proceedings.

If there are witnesses allowed in Trump's Senate trial (no sure thing), the House impeachment managers - effectively, the prosecutors in this case - may try to call the president to testify. Such a decision would raise issues of presidential privilege and immunity, however, as well as an individual's constitutional right against self-incrimination in legal proceedings.

All of this is uncharted terrain, of course. If it comes up, it would land at the feet of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who will preside over the president's Senate trial.

Another possibility is that Trump volunteers to testify in his own defence. He has expressed an openness to such a move in the past, but like many of his tweets and off-the-cuff statements, most observers suspect there was more bluster than substance to his suggestion. His political advisors would surely counsel against it.

What would the impact be on Trump's 2020 presidential bid if he was successfully impeached based on actions during his first term? - Grit Tokley, 29, London

That is the million-dollar question - and it's not clear what the answer is.

Republicans tout how impeachment has been a fundraising boon for Trump's presidential campaign, as his supporters rally around their embattled president.

Democrats counter that this vote will be a black mark on the president's name that voters will find impossible to ignore when casting their ballots.

Polls show a sharply divided nation whose opinions about the president, for and against, have not changed much because of the ongoing impeachment drama.

It is probably safe to say the 2020 election was going to be close before impeachment - and it will be close after.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A beginner's guide to impeachment and Trump

If Trump is acquitted, could he be charged in federal court after his term of office has ended? - Ethan, 29, Birmingham, UK

Nothing about the impeachment and removal process prevents a president from being tried for criminal violations after he or she leaves office. There are different standards in a criminal versus a Senate trial, of course. Impeachable offences need not be statutory crimes, and vice versa. But just because a president is forced from office does not shield him or her from legal exposure.

In fact, one of the most controversial episodes of Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal was when, after the 37th president had resigned rather than face impeachment, his successor, Gerald Ford, gave him a blanket pardon for all crimes he may have committed against the nation while in office. Otherwise, Nixon very probably would have faced indictment and trial.

Image copyright BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images

The pardon, which Ford cited as necessary to heal the nation, was a highly unpopular move and contributed to his defeat two years later when he sought election to a full four-year presidential term.

If Trump is impeached and Pence becomes president, is it legal in the US for him to appoint Trump as Vice-President, and then resign? - Harry, Beckenham

Well, there's nothing in the Constitution that forbids it, so it's certainly possible.

The first obstacle is that Mike Pence's appointment of Trump to the vice-presidency would have to be confirmed by a majority of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

Given that the Democrat-controlled House is on the verge of impeaching Trump, that seems unlikely.

There's also the possibility that, as part of its hypothetical vote to remove Trump from office, the Senate would specify that Trump is prohibited from holding future elected office. That would stop all this in its tracks.

But if the Senate didn't do that, there would be nothing stopping Pence from trying this gambit.

In fact, there would be nothing stopping Trump from continuing his bid for the presidency in 2020 and finding his way back to the White House that way.

If the Senate are (almost certainly) not going to vote to impeach Trump, then what is the point in this whole process? - Will Fox, 22, Leeds

If you listen to Democrats, the reason they're going through with this even though the outlook is slim to none for Senate conviction is because they feel obligated to hold the president accountable for his actions.

They view the president as having abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to open investigations into a political rival, and if they don't draw the line here - even if it doesn't result in his removal - the president will be emboldened to take further actions that could adversely affect Democrats in the 2020 election.

Then there's the purely political fact that the Democratic base have been howling for impeachment for months.

If Democratic officeholders hadn't taken action, they would have risked the ire of their most loyal supporters - and either faced primary challenges or lost general elections because their side didn't feel sufficiently motivated to turn out at the polls.

If the president is impeached but not convicted by the senate, is he allowed to run again? Are there any negatives for him? - Ben C, 24, Llanelli

He can absolutely run again. There is the possibility that impeachment could damage the president politically, which would adversely affect his chances at re-election, but there's nothing about the impeachment vote that would legally prohibit Trump from continuing his bid for re-election.

In fact, as previously mentioned, Trump could conceivably be impeached and removed by the Senate and still continue his current presidential campaign, as long as the Senate doesn't also vote to prohibit him from holding elected office.

How much is this actually costing the US tax payer? What have the Democrats achieved for US citizens in the past year? - Michael Mason, Maryland

If you're talking about actual cost in dollars and cents, that's hard to quantify. The Robert Mueller Russian meddling investigation had a $32m price tag, but the House Ukraine inquiry relied on existing staff and congressional resources.

If the question is one of opportunity cost, the missed chance to do other things, that's a political judgement.

Democrats have passed hundreds of pieces of legislation since taking over the House of Representatives - gun control, ethics and voting reform, raising the federal minimum wage, reauthorising the Violence Against Women Act and new environmental protections, for example - but very few have received a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.

In fact, the Congress has yet to agree on a budget for the 2020 fiscal year, which started in October. If it doesn't pass a stopgap measure to continue funding by midnight Friday, the federal government will shut down for the second time this year.

As Americans have seen, government shutdowns come with a very high political, and personal, price tag.

Who controls the trial of an impeached president, the nation's chief justice, or the jury of senators? - Radley Williams, Australia

The chief justice of the US Supreme Court is the constitutionally designated presiding officer of the Senate impeachment trial. While the framework for the trial will be voted on by the senators before it begins, John Roberts will have day-to-day control over the proceedings once the trial starts.

One important caveat, however. Rulings by the chief justice are subject to reversal by a simple majority vote of the 100-person Senate. In other words, Republicans - if they can agree - can change the rules of the trial any time they want.

If Trump has broken a constitutional law of the US and he is sent to the Senate for trial, but the Republicans control the Senate where it's reported that he'd be unlikely to be removed from office, how is that justice if he had actually committed a crime? - Paul

Perhaps justice has nothing to do with it. The men who wrote and approved the US constitution in 1787 made a conscious decision to make the impeachment and removal process a political one. They put politicians in charge of it, after all.

The American system of government was designed to set equal branches of government - the executive, the legislative and the judiciary - in constant tension. It was a way, they theorised, to prevent government tyranny.

Impeachment, then, is a tool that the legislative branch has to protect its prerogatives and keep the president accountable. Whether it's also a tool for "justice" is open for debate.

Should the Senate vote in line with political allegiance, as expected, or should they vote as independent jurors? - Will Barnett, Bristol, 26

Each senator will have to decide, based on his or her own conscience, how they should vote. Already some Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, have said their minds are made up and they will vote to acquit the president.

Many Democrats have made clear that they view the evidence presented in the House as grounds for Trump's removal.

Whether they're doing so because of political allegiance or because they've reached their own independent conclusion only they know for sure.

In the end, they will all have to justify their decision to voters if they hope to be re-elected to office. That, then, is the final - and perhaps only - accountability the US system of government provides.

How can Mitch McConnell possibly act impartially given his statement about acting in total coordination with the President's team? - Rolf Rees, Australia

The answer is that Mitch McConnell isn't going to act impartially.

He's the Republican Senate majority leader, and he's going to act in a way that benefits the Republican majority. Such is the nature of the political impeachment process.

If there's one thing McConnell has demonstrated time and again, it's that he's a savvy political player who is willing and able to use the powers of the Senate to advance his goals.

In this case, his desire is probably to have a smooth Senate trial that ends with the president's acquittal - an outcome that is more or less a foregone conclusion given the Republican majority in the chamber. In the interests of respecting precedent and satisfying public demand, he will endorse a process that he can defend as fair. But fairness is only part of his equation.

Oh, and Donald Trump's defenders have asserted that the Democrats running the House of Representatives didn't conduct their side of the process in an impartial fashion, either.
