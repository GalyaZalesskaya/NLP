      "Text:\n",
      "Image copyright Joel Gunter Image caption Nationalists descended on Charlottesville to defend a Confederate statue\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of Emancipation Park in Charlottesville on Saturday, two young women, one white and one black, took each other's hands and held them tightly, and with their other hands they gripped the steel barrier in front of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few feet away, a young white man with a buzzed haircut and sunglasses leaned towards them over a facing barrier. \"You'll be on the first f*****g boat home,\" he screamed at the black woman, before turning to the white woman. \"And as for you,\" he said coolly, \"you're going straight to hell.\" Then he gave a Nazi salute.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the third time in a few months, white nationalists had descended on the small, liberal city of Charlottesville in the southern state of Virginia, to protest against the planned removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time they came under the banner of the so-called \"alt-right\", for a rally they called \"Unite the Right\". They were a motley crew of militia, racists, and neo-Nazis, and some who said they simply wanted to defend their Southern history.\n",
      "\n",
      "They gathered early in the morning at Emancipation Park - formerly Lee Park - where the statue sits. Some were dressed in full tactical gear and openly carrying rifles. Others wore black shirts, helmets, and boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a column they surged into the park, using sticks and their fists to shove aside anti-fascist counter-protesters. Then they blocked off the entrance with shields. Inside, David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, grinned and waved as the crowd, almost entirely white and male, cheered him on, chanting his name and putting their arms up in Nazi salutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had reason to be pleased. They were in the middle of the largest gathering of white nationalists in America for decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nationalists clash with counter-protesters at the entrance to Emancipation Park\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright Reuters Image caption White nationalist militia descended on Charlottesville armed with rifles and handguns\n",
      "\n",
      "In the park, in a pen ringed by steel barriers, the nationalists shouted anti-immigrant, anti-semitic and racist slogans and targeted white women counter-protesters, calling them \"traitors\" who \"needed to get subjugated\". Outside, anti-fascist protesters threw bottles, rocks and paint and chanted \"Off our streets, Nazi scum\". Pepper spray, used by both sides, filled the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, riot police moved into the park and the streets around it, pushing everyone back. The governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency and the rally was cancelled. The national guard began to close off the area, but not before a driver ploughed into a crowd of counter-protesters two blocks away, killing a young woman and injuring 19 others.\n",
      "\n",
      "'One long prayer'\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty-four hours earlier, Reverend Brenda Brown-Grooms closed her eyes and prayed for peace. Sitting in a side room at St Paul's Memorial Church, while volunteers undertook non-violent resistance training next door, she prepared herself for a \"reckoning\" the following day in her home town.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is physically a very beautiful place, it has always been my template for what a city should look like,\" she said. \"But I've always understood that this beautiful place is also quite ugly. And the statue has become the match point for that ugliness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Reverend Brown-Grooms was born in Charlottesville in 1955. She grew up in Vinegar Hill, a black neighbourhood since razed to the ground in one of a series of redevelopment programmes that pushed the black community out of the city and into housing projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a girl, under segregation, she did not dare set foot in the white neighbourhood which was home to Emancipation Park - then Lee Park - and she had never been there until May, when the KKK came to town and lit torches under the statue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This summer has been one long prayer here in Charlottesville,\" she said. \"And now today we are praying again, we are praying that the alt-right don't start something tonight, ahead of the rally.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright Joel Gunter Image caption Rev Brenda Brown-Grooms: \"This beautiful place is also quite ugly\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a few hours, her prayer went unanswered. About 200 white nationalists gathered after dark in Nameless Field, down the road from where she sat, and marched through the University of Virginia campus holding torches. They chanted \"Blood and soil\" - an old Nazi slogan - and \"Jews will not replace us\".\n",
      "\n",
      "At the base of the university's statue of Thomas Jefferson, on the Main Street side of the campus, they were met by university students who came to resist them, linking arms and surrounding the statue. The air was hot from the torches and acrid from smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The heat here is nothing compared to what you're going to get in the ovens,\" shouted Robert Ray, a writer for the white supremacist website Daily Stormer. \"It's coming,\" he spat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"White supremacists walking through my university with torches, I never thought I'd have to see this in America in my lifetime,\" said one of the counter-protesters, a student who did not want to be named.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright Joel Gunter Image caption Hundreds of white nationalists gathered at the UVA statue of Thomas Jefferson on Friday night\n",
      "\n",
      "Directly across the street, at the same time, more than 500 people were packed into St. Paul's church for a multi-faith service. There were readings from the Bible and the Koran, spirituals sung by a choir, and a speech by activist and Harvard professor Dr Cornel West that drew everyone in the house to their feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is bleak that we are about to see the largest neo-fascist gathering in decades, but it is also a joy to be able to struggle against it, to bear witness to it,\" said Dr West after the service.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The alt-right is a new danger. We have a right-wing gangster in the White House who emboldens them, who empowers them. So they feel they have permission for their hate to come out in public, and maybe even harm others. We are in a dangerous moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the service drew to a close, and the last spirituals were sung, the congregation filed slowly out of a side door to avoid the white nationalists who were walking back up Main Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Racial realism'\n",
      "\n",
      "The speakers booked for the rally in Charlottesville were all men. The people who came to attend the rally were almost all men, and across the country the following of the so-called \"alt-right\" is overwhelmingly male.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the few women who speaks regularly at white nationalist events is Avialae Horton, a 20-year-old from Georgia who is editor of the Revolutionary Conservative, an online, right-wing newspaper with a mission to \"defend Western civilisation\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The members of the \"new-right\" are being unfairly branded as \"Nazis and fascists\", she said in Charlottesville ahead of the rally. \"We stand in confidence in our convictions, irrespective of what others think of that. And I absolutely believe that we have been misrepresented.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Speakers from the white nationalist movement claim its members are being misrepresented\n",
      "\n",
      "Three women from the Revolutionary Conservative flew into Charlottesville for the rally. They preach what they call \"racial realism\", which they say is not racism.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's natural for people to want to be with their own kind, and to look to their own interests,\" said RS McCoy, another member of staff from the paper, who came from California.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're going to care about our interests first, black people are going to care about their interests first, and even moving outside of race into things like LGBT, they're going to care about their interests first. And that is not bad, it doesn't have to be demonised.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Referred to as \"pea-soupers\", the most famous of these events was the so-called Great Smog of London in 1952. It was recently dramatised in the first series of the Netflix drama, The Crown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cold weather in the preceding days meant people had burned more coal - often of low quality, which released more sulphur dioxide - while inner-city coal power stations added to the haze. An anticyclone then settled over London, trapping cold air under a layer of warm air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smog lowered visibility to a few feet and, over four days, is thought to have killed more than 10,000 people.\n",

      "\n",
      "In 1956 the UK passed the Clean Air Act.\n",

      "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Australian firefighters battle a blaze at close range\n",
      "\n",
      "The sight of soaring flames, burning trees and scorched earth is becoming a familiar one for people around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Brazil to Australia, and from California to Indonesia, massive wildfires have torn through vast areas of forest this year. So how do you fight them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexander Held, an expert in wildfires at the European Forest Institute, and Kirsten Langmaid, a firefighter from Australia, talk us through the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step one: Preparation\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexander: Landowners and the authorities can absolutely take action to better prepare for wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "A top priority should be managing the amount of vegetation a fire can consume. This can be done with machinery or by grazing animals such as sheep or goats. Plus, if a wildfire runs into a pasture area then it will eventually die by itself because there won't be enough fuel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The controlled use of fire is another option. This involves burning some down some vegetation under carefully managed conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright EPA Image caption Fire crews work to create control lines - or fire breaks - which are areas free from vegetation. These help slow the progress of a wildfire\n",
      "\n",
      "In high-risk areas, there should also be control lines that divide up the land and make it harder for wildfires to spread. These can be things like roads, rivers, railway lines or constructed fire breaks. Fire breaks are areas that are free of vegetation.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also important for homeowners to make sure their house can be easily reached by firefighters. They need to keep on top of any potential burning material around their home, like gas tanks and fire wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption This home in California was overshadowed by towering smoke plumes\n",
      "\n",
      "Step two: Spotting the smoke\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexander: Most fire-prone countries have some form of early-warning system in place. These assess the temperature, fuel level, humidity and wind speed. These give a pretty good idea of what the coming days and weeks might look like.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there's an increased risk of wildfires then extra firefighters are put in place, trucks are prepared and the pilots of firefighting aircraft are put on standby.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a fire ignites then the first step in fighting it is smoke detection. That can either come from a member of the public who reports it or, in remote areas, cameras and lookout towers that spot it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some countries, firefighting aircraft are sent out at the first sign of smoke. But this is different in Europe where they don't tend to be mobilised until three or four days later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption If it is safe to do so, crews are sent in during the initial response to a wildfire\n",
      "\n",
      "Step three: First attack\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexander: This is the first phase of suppressing a wildfire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kirsten: We always send a rapid response team out during this first attack. These are crews who are fully kitted out with firefighting gear and water-carrying vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the location is a little more remote, then we'll send a plane or a small helicopter up straight away. This is usually just to check it out and they'll give us a rough estimate of how big the fire is.\n",
      "\n",
      "We use both dry and wet firefighting techniques. The dry method involves creating boundaries around the fire and letting it burn itself out. Either way, we try to contain it as soon as possible. Hopefully during this initial attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexander: But if you can't suppress the fire in the first hour then you move onto the next phase: the extended attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For larger wildfires, firefighting aircraft are used to drop water and fire retardant on the flames\n",
      "\n",
      "Step four: Extended attack\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexander: If it gets to this point then you need a lot more resources. The more time you give a wildfire to burn, the bigger they get and the more difficult they become to control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kirsten: As soon as the fire passes the first response phase we set up an incident control team. This means we have people back in the office co-ordinating the operation and thinking about the wider strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the fire is close to a town then we'll throw everything at it. Initially it's just vehicles and firefighters but then we'll move up to fire trucks and then much larger tankers. We use a lot of machinery, like bulldozers, to clear vegetation and create boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tactic we use at this point depends on the type of terrain. How we fight a grass fire differs dramatically to how we would fight a pine fire or a tall forest fire. But, generally speaking, it's a two-phased operation made-up of direct and indirect attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "We directly attack the flanks of the fire to narrow the front of it. This is often done with water, fire beaters or by digging earth boundaries parallel to the flames. We try to work from the areas that have already been burnt because these are unlikely to catch fire again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption These firefighters in California attempt to stop flames spreading from this home onto a nearby apartment complex\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexander: But if the fire is too intense and it's not safe to send people and fire trucks in, you move to indirect attacks. This means positioning crews away from the fire and attacking it with aircraft. You can also fight fire with fire by burning down vegetation ahead of the flames.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kirsten: When we move to indirect attacks we mainly use aircraft to drop fire retardant and water. But as soon as the smoke gets too bad and visibility becomes too poor, we have to bring them back down again. Another form of indirect attack is to dig control lines ahead of where the fire is going.\n",
      "\n",
      "We work with the police and the army to try and evacuate people and close roads. If it's too late for them to leave, then we'll put out the call to stay and defend. This is when it's actually safer for people to prepare their houses and stay inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a worst-case scenario we would have hundreds of people on the ground, multiple different agencies involved and multiple aircraft in the skies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Evacuations should be planned well in advance to avoid major traffic jams, experts say\n",
      "\n",
      "Step five: Mopping up\n",
      "\n",
      "Kirsten: A fire is under control when there's a working boundary around it or we've cut off its head. In other words - when it can't spread any further.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even when it's under control there's a long process of mopping up and putting out any lasting fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once we've tracked around the whole outside of the fire and it can no longer escape, we come in from the sides and put out any trees that are on fire. This is generally done with ground crews and machinery.\n",
      "\n",
      "We make sure everything around the perimeter edge is cold. In dry conditions, several days or weeks after a fire, if something is still smouldering and the wind picks up again then a spark could ignite a second blaze. So we take this mopping-up process very seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A burned neighbourhood is seen in Santa Rosa, California\n",
      "\n",
      "Step six: Aftermath\n",
      "\n",
      "Kirsten: Even weeks after a fire has gone cold, we will patrol the area and make sure it's safe. We'll assess whether to open it back up to the public and remove any trees that could fall down and hurt people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Community rehabilitation is the longest part of the process afterwards. After a major wildfire, the community could still be feeling its impact years later. Post-traumatic stress disorder is an issue and the government here in Australia provides counselling so people can rebuild their lives and businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "As firefighters, we try not to get too emotional. You see farms and houses go up in flames that you've been fighting for 10 hours to save. But then you look at an adjacent paddock or a house that you did manage to prevent from burning and it makes it all worthwhile.\n",

      "No, the main cause is a renewable energy source with an environmentally-friendly reputation - the humble wood-burning stove. Columns of smoke are rising from many of the houses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The latest surveys show that between 60% and 80% of fine-particle pollution here comes from wood-burning stoves and fireplaces in people's homes,\" says Vincent Hazout, who recently organised a demonstration calling for action against air pollution.

      "\n",
      "His office, though declining an interview, provided details of all the anti-air pollution measures taken this winter - and there are quite a few of them: restrictions on the most-polluting heavy goods vehicles, a voluntary slow-down of some industrial activity, a decrease in volume of refuse-burning and a ban on burning wood for households with alternative means of heating.\n",

      "\n",
      "He also says air quality is actually improving in Chamonix, because of an upgrade scheme for wood-burning stoves, which he has put in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the air quality in Chamonix on winter evenings is still poor. Plenty of wood smoke continues to pump fine particles into the air, despite this scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Vincent Hazout, the way forward is obvious. But it will take political will. Changing the way people heat their homes would have to become far more financially attractive or, if that failed, mandatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prof Kelly agrees. \"This pollution has three causes: the topography, the climate and the use of wood as heating fuel. We can't change the first two - although the Chinese have been experimenting with making rain to wash away pollution - but we can act on the wood-burning,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "In January 2015, the authorities in the Paris region banned the use of open fireplaces (more polluting than closed ones), before Ecology Minister Segolene Royal intervened to lift the order.\n",

      "It took her some time - because she used a different pen for each stroke, joking: \"It makes a funny signature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Reporters snapped photos of four trays, each holding eight pens engraved with Ms Pelosi's name, before the signing ceremony.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is actually a long-standing US tradition - since President Franklin Roosevelt, presidents have frequently used multiple pens to sign high-profile pieces of legislation, so they can be offered as souvenirs and historical keepsakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Donald Trump joked that he was running out of pens as he signed legislation on his inauguration day - while President Barack Obama used 22 pens to sign the Affordable Care Act into law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Pelosi has faced criticism for using several pens to sign the impeachment articles - with Republican critics saying she appeared to be celebrating what was supposed to be a sombre moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her office, however, argued that while impeachment is \"tragic... it is indisputably historic when the Constitution and its balance of power reasserts itself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in 1998, Republican senators also kept pens as souvenirs after signing oaths for the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton - although those pens had typos on the text inscribed on them, and had to be reissued.\n",

      "An impeachment walk - twice\n",
      "\n",
      "Following Wednesday's signing, the House clerk walked across the Capitol, under the iconic Rotunda, to deliver the two articles of impeachment to the Senate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright AFP Image caption House clerk Cheryl Johnson and Sergeant of Arms Paul Irving led Wednesday's procession\n",
      "\n",
      "She was accompanied by the House Sergeant at Arms and the seven impeachment managers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a rare moment when members of the House formally crossed over to the Senate - typically, the two chambers function separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tradition of the procession is thought to go back to the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in 1868. Lawmakers also made the same walk in 1998, when carrying articles impeaching President Bill Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ceremony and precedence play a role in strengthening the way in which legislative bodies function,\" Prof Richard Arenberg, an expert in Congressional history and procedures at Brown University, and a former Capitol Hill staffer, told the BBC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The procession \"symbolises the transmission of the solemn document enacted by the House of Representatives, and acceptance of it by the Senate\".\n",
      "\n",
      "When the procession arrived at the Senate chamber, the House clerk informed the Senate that the House had passed a resolution appointing the impeachment managers, and the Senate President, Republican Charles E Grassley, replied \"the message will be received\".\n",
      "\n",
      "House Democrats had to make the walk again on Thursday, as Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell asked them to return to formally exhibit the articles of impeachment then.\n",

      "But on Thursday, the sergeant of arms - Senate's chief law enforcement officer - kicked off proceedings by announcing: \"Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against Donald John Trump, president of the United States\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did he sound so formal? Most of the words he used are actually set out in the Senate impeachment rules, which were developed in 1868 and last revised in 1986.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is only the third impeachment trial in US history - a lot of the procedures have come through two centuries, without routine use, so they may seem archaic,\" Prof Arenberg says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, he adds, the traditions and ceremonies that have developed help underline the \"seriousness\" and \"sober gravity\" of what it taking place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Signing the oath book\n",
      "\n",
      "The Senate impeachment rules also specify that when it is the president or vice-president who is being impeached, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court should preside over the trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chief Justice Roberts had to be formally sworn in, before administering oaths for all 100 senators, who also had to sign an oath book that is kept in the national archives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prof Arenberg says it is significant that they are required to take a separate oath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is an additional oath above their oath of office - it's to underline that this is different from the partisan and legislative procedures they normally go through. Even beyond the oath of the Constitution when they take office, they need to additionally swear to offer impartial justice in this trial.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Senate then issued a formal summons to President Trump, informing him of the charges against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial is set to reconvene on Tuesday.\n",
